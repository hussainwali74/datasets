Procedural programming lacks the concept of objects and focuses on the steps or procedures to be executed.\nExample of procedural programming in PHP:\nCopy code"

Laravel provides an Event class that you can use to define custom events or you can use the predefined events provided by Laravel, such as authentication events (Illuminate\\Auth\\Events\\Login, Illuminate\\Auth\\Events\\Logout, etc.) or system events (Illuminate\\Console\\Events\\CommandExecuted, Illuminate\\Database\\Events\\QueryExecuted, etc.).\nExample:\nphp\nCopy code\nnamespace App\\Events;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Events\\Dispatchable;"
