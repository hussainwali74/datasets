The insert method is used to insert values into the linked list.\nTo perform binary search, we first convert the linked list into a sorted array using the toSortedArray method. This method traverses the linked list and constructs an array with the values in sorted order.\nThen, the binarySearch method performs the binary search on the sorted array. It initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, and iteratively calculates the middle index (mid) to compare the target value with the middle element. If the target value is found, it returns true. If the target value is smaller, the right pointer is adjusted. If the target value is larger, the left pointer is adjusted. The loop continues until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted.\nFinally, we create an instance of the LinkedList class, insert values into the linked list, and call the binarySearch method to search for a target value.\nThe output of the program will be true if the target value is found in the linked list, and false otherwise."

It uses a recursive approach to compare the nodes of the trees.\nThe function first checks the base cases: if both trees are null, they are identical (base case 1). If one tree is null and the other is not, they are not identical (base case 2).\nIf the above base cases are not met, the function compares the current node values of tree1 and tree2. If they are equal, it recursively calls areTreesIdentical for the left subtrees and right subtrees of both trees. If all these recursive calls return true, then the trees are considered identical.\nIn the example usage section, we create three binary trees: tree1, tree2, and tree3. tree1 and tree2 have the same structure and values, so the function call areTreesIdentical(tree1, tree2) returns true.

The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, considering substrings of different lengths and checking if the characters at the ends are equal.\nAfter filling the table, the function reconstructs the longest palindromic subsequence by backtracking from the top-right corner of the table. It compares characters of str and decides whether to include the character in the subsequence or move to the adjacent cell with the maximum length.\nFinally, the function returns the reconstructed longest palindromic subsequence.\nIn the example usage section, we demonstrate the usage of the longestPalindromicSubsequence function with an example string (str). The resulting longest palindromic subsequence is printed to the console."

It has two arrays: parent to store the parent of each element and rank to store the rank (approximate depth) of each element's tree.\nThe constructor initializes the parent array such that each element is initially its own parent, and the rank array is initially all zeros.\nThe find method finds the root (representative) of the set to which the given element x belongs. During the find operation, path compression is applied to make the found root the direct parent of x for future lookups, which helps to flatten the tree structure.\nThe union method performs the union of two sets represented by elements x and y. It first finds the roots of the sets using the find method. Then, it compares the ranks of the roots and attaches the tree with the smaller rank to the root with the larger rank. If the ranks are equal, one tree is attached to the other, and the rank of the new root is incremented.\nThe isConnected method checks if two elements x and y are in the same set by comparing their root elements.\nIn the example usage section, we demonstrate the usage of the DisjointSet class by creating a disjoint-set with five elements. We perform some union operations and check the connectivity of elements using the isConnected method. The results are printed to the console."

It initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, and iteratively calculates the middle index (mid) to compare the target value with the middle element. If the target value is found, it returns true. If the target value is smaller, the right pointer is adjusted. If the target value is larger, the left pointer is adjusted. The loop continues until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted.\nFinally, we create an instance of the LinkedList class, insert values into the linked list, and call the binarySearch method to search for a target value.\nThe output of the program will be true if the target value is found in the linked list, and false otherwise."

If one tree is null and the other is not, they are not identical (base case 2).\nIf the above base cases are not met, the function compares the current node values of tree1 and tree2. If they are equal, it recursively calls areTreesIdentical for the left subtrees and right subtrees of both trees. If all these recursive calls return true, then the trees are considered identical.\nIn the example usage section, we create three binary trees: tree1, tree2, and tree3. tree1 and tree2 have the same structure and values, so the function call areTreesIdentical(tree1, tree2) returns true.

The UNCOLORED color indicates that a node hasn't been colored yet.\nThe dfs helper function performs the depth-first search. It takes a node and a color as input. It colors the current node with the specified color and recursively calls dfs on its neighbors, ensuring that they are colored with the opposite color (3 - color). If it encounters a neighbor that has already been colored with the same color, it returns false, indicating that the graph is not bipartite. If a recursive call returns false, the function also returns false.\nThe main logic of the isBipartite function iterates through each node in the graph. If a node hasn't been colored yet (Color.UNCOLORED), it starts a new DFS from that node with the color Color.RED. If any connected component is found to be not bipartite during the DFS, the function returns false. Otherwise, if all connected components are successfully colored and no conflicts are found, the function returns true.\nIn the example usage section, we provide two example graphs (graph1 and graph2). We call the isBipartite function on each graph and print the result to the console, demonstrating the bipartiteness check for different graphs."

It calculates the hashes for the element using the getHashes method and checks if all corresponding positions in the bit array are true. If any position is false, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.\nThe getHashes method calculates multiple hashes for an element by invoking the hash method for different seed values.\nThe hash method calculates a hash value for an element using the specified seed. It iterates through each character of the element, performs a simple hashing algorithm (multiplication and modulo), and returns the resulting hash value.\nIn the example usage section, we create an instance of the BloomFilter class with a bit array size of 100 and 3 hash functions.

During the find operation, path compression is applied to make the found root the direct parent of x for future lookups, which helps to flatten the tree structure.\nThe union method performs the union of two sets represented by elements x and y. It first finds the roots of the sets using the find method. Then, it compares the ranks of the roots and attaches the tree with the smaller rank to the root with the larger rank. If the ranks are equal, one tree is attached to the other, and the rank of the new root is incremented.\nThe isConnected method checks if two elements x and y are in the same set by comparing their root elements.\nIn the example usage section, we demonstrate the usage of the DisjointSet class by creating a disjoint-set with five elements. We perform some union operations and check the connectivity of elements using the isConnected method. The results are printed to the console."
