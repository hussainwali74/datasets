    "question":"what will come in place of question mark: 24,12,12,18, 36, 90, ?",
    "answer":"To solve this sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step:\n1. 24, 12: The first number is divided by 2 to get the second number (24 / 2 = 12).\n 2. 12, 12: The second number is the same as the third number (12 = 12).\n 3. 12, 18: The third number is multiplied by 1.5 to get the fourth number (12 * 1.5 = 18).\n 4. 18, 36: The fourth number is multiplied by 2 to get the fifth number (18 * 2 = 36).\n 5. 36, 90: The fifth number is multiplied by 2.5 to get the sixth number (36 * 2.5 = 90).\n Now, let's try to identify a pattern in the multipliers:\n 1. 2 (division)\n 2. 1 (no change)\n 3. 1.5\n 4. 2\n 5. 2.5\n The multipliers seem to be increasing by 0.5 after the first two steps. If we continue this pattern, the next multiplier should be 3 (2.5 + 0.5). Therefore, the next number in the sequence should be:\n 90 * 3 = 270\n So, the sequence is: 24, 12, 12, 18, 36, 90, 270."
