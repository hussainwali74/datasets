Hyperparameters are variables that determine the structure of the model and how it is trained, such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers, and number of hidden units\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n. The importance of hyperparameter tuning in deep learning lies in the fact that the performance of the model is highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n. If the hyperparameters are not set correctly, the model may not converge or may converge to a suboptimal solution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n. The process of hyperparameter tuning involves selecting a range of values for each hyperparameter and evaluating the performance of the model for each combination of hyperparameters\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n. There are several techniques for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.
