NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python\n1\n2\n3\n. It is open-source software and is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning\n4\n5\n.\nHere's a simple example of creating a NumPy array in Python:\npython\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a 1D array\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(a)\n\n# Create a 2D array\nb = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nprint(b)\nThis program first imports the NumPy library using the import statement and aliases it as np. It then creates a one-dimensional array a and a two-dimensional array b using the np.array() function and prints them. NumPy arrays are accessed using square brackets and can be initialized using nested Python lists\n1\n2\n.\nNumPy also provides a number of functions for working with arrays, such as np.zeros(), np.ones(), and np.arange(). For example, the following code creates a 3x3 array of zeros using np.zeros():\npython\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a 3x3 array of zeros\na = np.zeros((3, 3))\nprint(a)\nThis program creates a 3x3 array of zeros using the np.zeros() function and prints it. The np.zeros() function takes a tuple specifying the shape of the array as its argument\n1\n2\n.\n1\nw3schools\n2\ngeeksforgeeks\n3\ngeeksforgeeks\n4\nnumpy\n5\nnature"
