        "Output": "A primary key is a special column or combination of columns in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It is used as a unique identifier to quickly parse data within the table and is critical to an efficient relational database. A primary key must contain a unique value for each row of data, cannot contain null values, and every row must have a primary key value. The primary key can consist of one or more columns, and it can use one or more fields already present in the underlying data model, or a specific extra field can be created to be the primary key. The primary key is important because it helps to ensure data consistency and integrity, and it allows you to retrieve every single piece of data you have inserted into a database by using only three pieces of information: the name of the table, the name of the column, and the primary key of the row\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\ntechopedia\n2\ntechtarget\n3\nsecoda\n4\nwikipedia\n5\nibm\n6\nrelationaldbdesign"

This ensures that the data in the foreign key column of the referencing table matches the data in the primary key column of the referenced table. The foreign key constraint prevents actions that would destroy links between tables and ensures that the data in the foreign key column is valid. A foreign key can be created using the FOREIGN KEY constraint in SQL\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\nwikipedia\n2\nw3schools\n3\nmicrosoft\n4\ntechtarget\n5\nmysql\n6\ntutorialspoint"

It is a unique data structure that stores only a sorted subset of the data separately from the table rows. Indexes allow the database engine to quickly find rows with specific column values, without scanning all the rows in a table for a given query. They help retrieve data faster, speed up searches of data, and improve the performance of the database. Indexes can be created using one or more columns, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient ordering of access to records. They can be used to speed up queries that require a search and to enforce value uniqueness. MySQL supports different types of indexes, including unique indexes, prefix indexes, and invisible indexes\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\ndigitalocean\n2\nmysqltutorial\n3\njavatpoint\n4\nsection\n5\ntutorialspoint\n6\nmysql"

It is a logical table that does not exist physically but is created by a SELECT statement that retrieves data from one or more tables in the database. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, provide a subset of data from a table, or restrict access to certain data. They are stored in the database as a pre-established query command in the data dictionary. Views can be queried in the same manner as a persistent database collection object, and changes applied to the data in a relevant underlying table are reflected in the data shown in subsequent invocations of the view. Views can provide advantages over tables, such as limiting the degree of exposure of the underlying tables to the outer world, taking very little space to store, and providing an additional level of table security by restricting access to a predetermined set of rows and columns of a table\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\nwikipedia\n2\nnavicat\n3\noodlestechnologies\n4\nibm\n5\nessentialsql\n6\ngeeksforgeeks"

It is a group of pre-compiled SQL statements that can be reused again and again. Stored procedures are similar to functions in programming and can perform specified operations when called. They are used to perform a wide range of database operations such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, generating reports, and performing complex calculations. Stored procedures are very useful because they allow you to encapsulate a set of SQL statements as a single unit and execute them repeatedly with different parameters, making it easy to manage and reuse code. Stored procedures can be created using the CREATE PROCEDURE statement in SQL, and they can be tested by executing them with different input parameters. Stored procedures provide an important layer of security between the user interface and the database, and they support security through data access controls because end users may enter or change data, but do not write procedures. They also preserve data integrity because information is entered in a consistent manner and improve productivity because statements in a stored procedure only must be written once.\n1\ndatabasestar\n2\nprogramiz\n3\ntutorialspoint\n4\nw3schools\n5\ntechtarget"

Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and perform complex data validation. They can be created using the CREATE TRIGGER statement in SQL, and they can be defined to execute either before or after the triggering event. Triggers can be used to perform a wide range of actions, such as auditing changes to data, enforcing referential integrity, and updating summary tables. They are useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention, and they can help to ensure that data is consistent and accurate.\n1\nc-sharpcorner\n2\ngeeksforgeeks\n3\nsqlshack\n4\njavatpoint\n5\ntutorialsteacher"

Transactions are used to perform a wide range of database operations such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, generating reports, and performing complex calculations. Transactions must satisfy the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) to be considered valid. The ACID properties ensure that transactions are treated as a single unit of work, that all operations must succeed for any changes to be committed to the database, and that there must be no state in a database where a transaction is left partially completed. Transactions are commonly associated with databases and are used to ensure the integrity of the data.\n1\nquizlet\n2\nquizlet\n3\nthetechedvocate\n4\ntutorialspoint\n5\nwikipedia"
