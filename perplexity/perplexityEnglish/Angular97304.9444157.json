An NgModule is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities\n1\n. It is a technique used to build a loosely coupled but highly cohesive system in Angular\n2\n. An NgModule is a collection of components, services, directives, and pipes that are closely related and meant to be used together\n3\n. Every Angular application must have at least one NgModule, which is the root module\n2\n. The root NgModule is used to bootstrap the Angular application, and it is in this root module that we also bootstrap the root-level component\n2\n.\nOn the other hand, a Component is a fundamental block of Angular, and multiple components make up an application\n4\n. A component is a directive with a template\n1\n. It is a building block of an Angular application, and it defines a section of the user interface (UI)\n5\n. A component is responsible for rendering a view, which is a portion of the screen that displays data from the application's model\n1\n.\nIn summary, while an NgModule is a container for a cohesive block of code, a Component is a building block of an Angular application that defines a section of the user interface.\n1\nangular\n2\ntelerik\n3\nangular-university\n4\nstackoverflow\n5\nrainerhahnekamp"

These hooks provide visibility into key life moments and the ability to act when they occur\n1\n. By implementing these hooks, developers can tap into the lifecycle of a component and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle. Here are the different Angular component lifecycle hooks:\nngOnChanges: This hook is called when any data-bound property of a component changes. It receives a SimpleChanges object that contains the previous and current values of the changed property\n2\n.\nngOnInit: This hook is called once, after the first ngOnChanges hook is called. It is used to initialize the component's properties\n1\n.\nngDoCheck: This hook is called during every change detection cycle. It is used to detect and act upon changes that Angular does not detect automatically\n2\n.\nngAfterContentInit: This hook is called after the component's content has been projected into its view. It is used to perform initialization that requires access to the component's content\n1\n.\nngAfterContentChecked: This hook is called after every check of the component's content.

        "Output": "In Angular, the template URL and style URLs properties are used in a component to define the location of the HTML template and CSS stylesheets for that component, respectively\n1\n2\n. Here is a brief explanation of each property:\nTemplate URL: This property is used to specify the location of the HTML template file for the component. The template can be defined either inline in the component metadata or in an external file using the template URL property\n1\n2\n. If the template is defined in an external file, the template URL property is used to specify the path to that file\n1\n2\n.\nStyle URLs: This property is used to specify the location of one or more CSS stylesheets for the component.

        "Input": "How do you handle user input in Angular?",
        "Output": "In Angular, there are different ways to handle user input. Here are some ways to handle user input in Angular:\nEvent bindings: Angular event bindings can be used to respond to any DOM event triggered by user input. This provides a way to get input from users\n1\n2\n. For example, we can listen to button clicks as follows:\n<button (click)=\"onButtonClick()\">Click me</button>\nThis code binds the onButtonClick() method to the click event of the button.\nTwo-way data binding: Two-way data binding allows for the synchronization of data between the component and the view. This means that changes made in the view are automatically reflected in the component, and vice versa\n3\n. Two-way data binding can be used to handle user input in forms, such as input fields and checkboxes.\nTemplate-driven forms: Angular provides a template-driven approach to handling user input through forms. This approach uses directives to bind input fields to properties in the component, and it relies on Angular to track the form and its validation state\n3\n4\n.\nReactive forms: Reactive forms provide a more flexible approach to handling user input through forms. This approach uses a reactive programming model to manage the form state, and it allows for more fine-grained control over the form validation and submission process\n3\n4\n.\nIn summary, Angular provides different ways to handle user input, including event bindings, two-way data binding, template-driven forms, and reactive forms. Developers can choose the approach that best suits their needs and the requirements of their application.\n1\nangular\n2\nw3resource\n3\nangular\n4\nangular"

        "Input": "What is Angular routing and how does it work?",
        "Output": "Angular routing is a feature that allows developers to define how users navigate through an application by using routes\n1\n2\n. Routing lets you display specific views of your application depending on the URL\n1\n. When a user navigates from one route to another, the Angular router maps the URL path to a relevant component and displays its view\n3\n. Here is how Angular routing works:\nDefining routes: To define routes in an Angular application, developers use the RouterModule and Routes modules. The RouterModule provides the necessary service providers and directives for routing, while the Routes module defines the routes themselves\n1\n4\n.\nConfiguring routes: Once the routes are defined, developers can configure them by specifying the path, component, and any additional data or parameters for each route\n1\n4\n.\nNavigating between routes: To navigate between routes, developers can use the routerLink directive in the HTML template or the Router service in the component code. The routerLink directive creates a hyperlink that, when clicked, navigates to the specified route. The Router service provides methods for navigating programmatically, such as navigate() and navigateByUrl()\n1\n5\n.\nRoute guards: Angular also provides route guards, which are used to protect routes from unauthorized access. Route guards can be used to check if a user is authenticated, if they have the necessary permissions, or if they are allowed to access a specific route\n6\n.\nIn summary, Angular routing is a powerful feature that allows developers to define how users navigate through an application and display specific views depending on the URL. By using routes, developers can create a more organized and structured application that is easier to maintain and scale.\n1\nangular\n2\nangular\n3\nangular\n4\nangular\n5\nangular\n6\nangular"

        "Input": "What is dependency injection in Angular and why is it important?",
        "Output": "Dependency injection is a design pattern used in Angular that allows components, services, and modules to be interdependent while maintaining consistency over external dependencies injected in the application\n1\n2\n. Dependency injection is a way of providing objects that a class needs (its dependencies) to work\n3\n. Instead of creating objects inside a class, the objects are passed to the class from an external source, which makes the code more modular and easier to test\n1\n4\n. Here are some reasons why dependency injection is important in Angular:\nModularity: Dependency injection makes it easier to create modular and reusable code by separating concerns and reducing coupling between components\n1\n4\n.\nTestability: Dependency injection makes it easier to test components in isolation by allowing developers to mock or replace dependencies with test doubles\n1\n4\n.\nFlexibility: Dependency injection makes it easier to change the behavior of an application by allowing developers to swap out dependencies without changing the code that uses them\n1\n4\n.\nScalability: Dependency injection makes it easier to scale an application by allowing developers to add or remove dependencies as needed without changing the code that uses them\n1\n4\n.\nIn summary, dependency injection is a powerful feature of Angular that allows developers to create modular, testable, flexible, and scalable code by separating concerns and reducing coupling between components.\n1\ndotnettricks\n2\nfreecodecamp\n3\nangular\n4\nangular-university"
