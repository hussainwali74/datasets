A hash function is an algorithm that produces an index of where a value can be found or stored in the hash table. The hash function takes the key as input and returns an index in the hash table where the corresponding value can be found. The hash table uses an array of linked lists to store the key-value pairs. When a key-value pair is inserted into the hash table, the hash function is used to determine the index where the pair should be stored. If there is already a key-value pair stored at that index, a collision occurs. To handle collisions, the hash table uses a technique called chaining, where a linked list is created at the index to store all the key-value pairs that hash to that index. When searching for a value in the hash table, the hash function is used to determine the index where the value should be stored. If there is a key-value pair stored at that index, the linked list is searched to find the value. Hash tables are used to quickly store and retrieve data (or records) and are commonly used in databases, compilers, and network routers\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\nstackoverflow\n2\nfreecodecamp\n3\nwikipedia\n4\nyoutube\n5\nkhalilstemmler\n6\nhackerearth"

It is a tree that stores the data in an ordered and efficient way. Each node of a trie can have as many as 26 references (pointers), and each node consists of a character and a boolean value that is used to implement whether this character represents the end of the word. Tries are generally used to store strings and are well-suited to matching algorithms, as they are based on the prefix of each string. Tries are typically employed when dealing with groups of strings rather than individual strings, enabling them to solve a wide range of problems. Some advantages of using a trie data structure include faster insertion and searching of strings in O(L) time, where L represents the length of a single word. This is faster than a binary search tree and hashing because of the ways it is implemented. Tries can store strings of any language, as they are based on the characters of the strings rather than their encoding. Tries are also useful for efficiently doing prefix search (or auto-complete) and printing all words in alphabetical order, which is not easily possible with hashing. However, a trie is a very specialized data structure that requires much more memory than trees and lists, and it is not suitable for all types of data\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\nstudytonight\n2\ngeeksforgeeks\n3\ntoptal\n4\nhackerearth\n5\nwikipedia\n6\nopengenus"

The technique is based on the principle of optimal substructure, which means that the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems. Dynamic programming is useful in solving problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property. It is mainly an optimization over plain recursion and reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. Dynamic programming can be applied to any problem that requires the re-calculation of certain values to reach the final solution. Some examples of problems that can be solved using dynamic programming include finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, sorting algorithms, and finding the kth largest/smallest element in an array. Dynamic programming can be applied in two ways: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down is also known as memoization, where the results of subproblems are stored in memory for future reference.

It involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization is the top-down approach to solving a problem with dynamic programming. It is called memoization because we will create a memo, or a “note to self”, for the values returned from solving each problem. Then, when we encounter the same problem again, we simply check the memo, and, rather than solving the problem a second (or third or fourth) time, we retrieve the solution from our memo. Memoization is generally more intuitive to implement, especially when we don’t know the solution to subproblems, whereas tabulation requires us to know the solution to subproblems. Memoization is a common strategy in dynamic programming, a computer programming technique that involves breaking a large problem into overlapping subproblems. By trading computer memory usage for improved runtime, memoization makes some otherwise intractable recursive functions possible.

The value of the element itself is considered for assigning the priority. For example, the element with the highest value is considered the highest priority element. However, in other cases, we can assume the element with the lowest value as the highest priority element. We can also set priorities according to our needs.

Priority queues have many applications in other algorithms such as Dijkstra and scheduling algorithms. Priority queues are very important to systems that juggle multiple programs and their execution (programs are chosen to run based on their priority). They are also very important to networking systems, like the internet, because they can help prioritize important data to make sure it gets through faster.

The hash function is used to map a key to a bucket. However, it will not store that key in that bucket, it will simply mark it as filled. So, many keys might map to the same filled bucket, creating false positives. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either \"possibly in set\" or \"definitely not in set\". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting Bloom filter variant).\nBloom filters are useful in various applications, including digital signal processing, network routers, and packet switching. Bloom filters are used to efficiently determine which web objects to store in web caches. Bloom filters are also used in Bitcoin to minimize the risk of triggering DDoS attacks. Bloom filters can be used as the first layer of filtering, where they require constant space. They can be helpful where we want to know if something is definitely not present or possibly present somewhere. Bloom filters are a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that can tell whether an element may be in a set or definitely is not\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\nbrilliant\n2\nwikipedia\n3\nopengenus\n4\nllimllib\n5\nenjoyalgorithms\n6\ngeeksforgeeks"

        "Output": "Amortized analysis is a method used in computer science to analyze the average performance of an algorithm over multiple operations. It is a technique used to estimate the average time complexity of an algorithm over a sequence of operations, rather than the worst-case complexity of individual operations. The idea behind amortized analysis is to distribute the cost of expensive operations over a sequence of less expensive operations. The basic idea is to spread the cost of these expensive operations over multiple operations, so that the average cost of each operation is constant or less.\nAmortized analysis is useful when the worst-case analysis of an algorithm is too pessimistic, and the average-case analysis is too optimistic. Amortized analysis allows us to make more accurate predictions about the overall efficiency of an algorithm, especially in cases where some operations may take longer than others. There are three main types of amortized analysis: aggregate analysis, the accounting method, and the potential method.\nAggregate analysis involves analyzing the total cost of a sequence of operations and dividing it by the number of operations. The accounting method involves assigning a cost to each operation and using the cost to pay for future operations. The potential method involves assigning a potential function to the data structure and using it to measure the cost of each operation.\nAmortized analysis is used in various applications, including dynamic arrays, hash tables, and binary search trees. It allows us to estimate the average time complexity of an algorithm over a sequence of operations, which can be useful in designing and analyzing algorithms\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\ncmu\n2\nbrilliant\n3\nwikipedia\n4\ntutorialspoint\n5\ngeeksforgeeks\n6\ncornell"

Radix trees are useful for constructing associative arrays with keys that can be expressed as strings. They find particular application in the area of IP routing, where the ability to contain large ranges of values with a few exceptions is particularly suited to the hierarchical organization of IP addresses. They are also used for inverted indexes of text documents in information retrieval. Radix trees support insertion, deletion, and searching operations. Insertion adds a new string to the trie while trying to minimize the amount of data stored. Deletion removes a string from the trie while trying to minimize the amount of data stored. Searching finds the value associated with a given key. Radix trees embed their data in the sequence of edges leading to the node. That means that only the leaves (the nodes at the bottom) really represent a coded value. The coded value is the path leading to it. Radix trees also leverage something called “path compression” to save on the node overhead by merging nodes.

        "Output": "Huffman coding is a technique used to compress data by assigning variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence. The codes are assigned in such a way that no code is a prefix of any other code, which ensures that the codes can be uniquely decoded. The Huffman coding algorithm uses a tree-based data structure to generate the codes. The tree is constructed by repeatedly merging the two nodes with the lowest frequency until a single node is left, which becomes the root of the tree. The left and right branches of the tree represent the 0 and 1 bits of the code, respectively. The codes are generated by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes, assigning a 0 or 1 bit to each branch depending on whether it is a left or right branch. The resulting code for each character is the sequence of 0 and 1 bits from the root to the corresponding leaf node.\nThe Huffman coding algorithm is used in various applications, including data compression, image compression, and text encoding. It is a lossless compression technique, which means that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.\nIn summary, Huffman coding is a technique used to compress data by assigning variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence.

BFS is useful for analyzing the nodes in a graph and constructing the shortest path of traversing through these. BFS can traverse through a graph in the smallest number of iterations. The architecture of the BFS algorithm is simple and robust. The result of the BFS algorithm holds a high level of accuracy in comparison to other algorithms. BFS iterations are seamless, and there is no possibility of this algorithm getting caught up in an infinite loop problem.\nThere are multiple ways to implement BFS in Java. We can use an adjacency list for the representation of the graph and can cover both recursive as well as an iterative approach for implementation of the algorithm. The iterative implementation for the BFS algorithm in Java is as follows:\nvoid BFS(int vertex) {\n    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();\n    visited[vertex] = true;\n    queue.add(vertex);\n    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\n        int current = queue.poll();\n        System.out.print(current + \" \");\n        for (int neighbor : adjLists[current]) {\n            if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n                visited[neighbor] = true;\n                queue.add(neighbor);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nIn this implementation, the BFS function takes a starting vertex as input and performs a breadth-first search on the graph. The function marks the starting vertex as visited, enqueues it onto the queue, and then iteratively dequeues the vertices from the queue and visits them. For each unvisited neighbor of the visited vertex, the function marks it as visited and enqueues it onto the queue.\nIn summary, to implement a BFS algorithm on a graph, we need to create a queue and enqueue the starting vertex onto the queue. We then mark the starting vertex as visited and while the queue is not empty, we dequeue a vertex from the queue and visit it. For each unvisited neighbor of the visited vertex, we mark it as visited and enqueue it onto the queue.

This can happen due to the finite size of the table and the infinite number of possible keys. When a collision occurs, the hash table needs to resolve the collision by storing the multiple keys in the same bucket or by finding a different bucket to store the key. There are several techniques to handle hash collisions, including:\nSeparate Chaining: In this technique, each bucket in the hash table is a linked list, and collisions are resolved by adding the new key to the linked list at the corresponding bucket.\nOpen Addressing: In this technique, when a collision occurs, the hash table looks for the next available bucket in a predetermined sequence of buckets until an empty bucket is found.\nLinear Probing: In this technique, when a collision occurs, the hash table looks for the next available bucket in a linear sequence until an empty bucket is found.\nQuadratic Probing: In this technique, when a collision occurs, the hash table looks for the next available bucket in a quadratic sequence until an empty bucket is found.\nHash collisions can affect the performance of a hash table by increasing the time required to search for a key or by increasing the size of the hash table. Therefore, it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes the number of collisions and to use an appropriate collision resolution technique to handle collisions. A well-designed hash table typically presents few collisions, and the choice of collision resolution technique depends on the specific application and the expected number of collisions\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n1\nbaeldung\n2\nharvard\n3\ngeeksforgeeks\n4\ngeeksforgeeks\n5\nhackerearth\n6\nustc"

The aim of a self-organizing list is to improve the efficiency of linear search by moving more frequently accessed items towards the head of the list. The simplest implementation of a self-organizing list is as a linked list, but it suffers from inefficient accesses to random nodes. To reduce this inefficiency, a self-organizing list uses a reorganizing algorithm to adapt to various query distributions at runtime. There are several strategies used by self-organizing lists, including:\nMove-to-Front Method: In this method, any node searched is moved to the front of the list. This method adapts quickly to changing access patterns.\nCount Method: In this method, each node has a count associated with it, and the nodes are reordered based on their counts. This method adapts more slowly to changing access patterns.\nTranspose Method: In this method, any node searched is swapped with the preceding node. This method does not adapt quickly to changing access patterns.\nSelf-organizing lists use a heuristic for deciding how to reorder the list. These heuristics are similar to the rules for managing buffer pools. In fact, a buffer pool is a form of self-organizing list. Ordering the buffer pool by expected frequency of access is a good strategy, because typically we must search the contents of the buffers to determine if the desired information is already in main memory. While self-organizing lists do not generally perform as well as search trees or a sorted list, both of which require O(log n) search time, there are many situations in which self-organizing lists prove a valuable tool.\nIn summary, a self-organizing list is a data structure that reorders its elements based on some self-organizing heuristic to improve average access time.

In a min-heap, the minimum element is always at the root of the heap, and its time complexity is O(1). In a max-heap, the minimum element is not readily available, and we need to traverse the heap to find it. The brute force approach for finding the minimum element in a max-heap is to check all the nodes in the heap, which has a time complexity of O(n). However, an efficient approach is to use the max-heap property, which requires that the parent node be greater than its child node(s). Due to this property, we can conclude that a non-leaf node cannot be the minimum element as its child node has a lower value. So we can narrow down our search to the leaf nodes of the heap, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for a heap with n elements.\nIn summary, the time complexity of finding the minimum element in a heap data structure depends on whether the heap is a min-heap or a max-heap.

The push method simply adds an element to q1. The pop method moves all but the last element from q1 to q2, removes the last element from q1, and then swaps q1 and q2. The top method is similar to the pop method, but it also adds the last element from q1 to q2 before swapping the queues. The empty method returns True if q1 is empty.\nIn summary, the Stack class implements a stack using two queues. The push method adds an element to the stack, the pop method removes and returns the top element from the stack, the top method returns the top element from the stack without removing it, and the empty method returns True if the stack is empty. The implementation uses two queues to simulate the stack operations\n1\n.\n1\ngeeksforgeeks"

        "Output": "A circular buffer, also known as a ring buffer, is a fixed-size data structure that is commonly used in real-time software applications to store a pre-defined number of values. It is particularly useful in situations where the data is continuously being sampled and calculations need to be done using a pre-defined sample size or continuous visualization is required. The analogy of a ring with a fixed number of positions is quite useful to capture the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) nature of such data structure. Once the buffer is full, the first element that was written (“In” ) to the buffer is the first one to be overwritten (“Out”) by the next incoming element.\nA circular buffer can be implemented using an array or a linked list. The most elegant way to implement the circular buffer is using an array. The array can be initialized with a fixed size, and two pointers can be used to keep track of the read and write positions. The read pointer points to the next element to be read, and the write pointer points to the next element to be written. When the write pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning of the array. Similarly, when the read pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning of the array.\nHere is a Python implementation of a circular buffer using an array:\npython\nclass CircularBuffer:\n    def __init__(self, size):\n        self.size = size\n        self.buffer = [None] * size\n        self.read = 0\n        self.write = 0\n\n    def write_value(self, value):\n        self.buffer[self.write] = value\n        self.write = (self.write + 1) % self.size\n        if self.write == self.read:\n            self.read = (self.read + 1) % self.size\n\n    def read_value(self):\n        if self.read == self.write:\n            return None\n        value = self.buffer[self.read]\n        self.read = (self.read + 1) % self.size\n        return value\nThe CircularBuffer class has an instance variable buffer that represents the circular buffer, which is an array of size size. The read and write pointers keep track of the read and write positions in the buffer. The write_value method writes a value to the buffer at the current write position, and then increments the write pointer. If the write pointer reaches the read pointer, the read pointer is incremented to avoid overwriting the oldest value in the buffer. The read_value method reads a value from the buffer at the current read position, and then increments the read pointer. If the read pointer reaches the write pointer, None is returned to indicate that the buffer is empty.\nIn summary, a circular buffer is a fixed-size data structure that is commonly used in real-time software applications to store a pre-defined number of values. It can be implemented using an array or a linked list.

BFS is used to search a graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. The algorithm can be used to solve many problems in graph theory, such as finding the shortest path between two vertices.\nTo perform a BFS on a graph, we can use a queue data structure to store the nodes that need to be visited. We start by adding the root node to the queue, and then repeatedly remove the first node from the queue, visit its neighbors, and add them to the queue if they have not been visited yet. We mark each visited node as visited to avoid processing it more than once.\nHere is a Python implementation of a BFS algorithm for a graph using a queue:\npython\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self, vertices):\n        self.vertices = vertices\n        self.adj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n\n    def add_edge(self, u, v):\n        self.adj_list[u].append(v)\n        self.adj_list[v].append(u)\n\n    def bfs(self, start):\n        visited = {v: False for v in self.vertices}\n        queue = deque([start])\n        visited[start] = True\n        while queue:\n            node = queue.popleft()\n            print(node, end=' ')\n            for neighbor in self.adj_list[node]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    visited[neighbor] = True\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\nThe Graph class has an instance variable adj_list that represents the adjacency list of the graph, which is a dictionary that maps each vertex to a list of its neighbors. The bfs method takes a starting vertex as input and performs a BFS on the graph, printing the visited nodes in the order they were visited. The method uses a boolean visited dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes, and a deque data structure to implement the queue.\nIn summary, a BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at the root of the graph and visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

The program also defines two functions: height() and isBalanced(). The height() function calculates the height of a node in the binary tree recursively. The isBalanced() function checks if a given binary tree is balanced by calculating the height of the left and right subtrees of each node and checking if the difference between the heights is not more than 1. If the difference is more than 1 for any node, the function returns false. Otherwise, it recursively checks if the left and right subtrees are balanced.\nThe main() function creates a binary tree, checks if it is balanced using isBalanced(), and prints a message indicating whether the binary tree is balanced or not.\nFor example, the following code creates a binary tree, checks if it is balanced, and prints a message:\nc++\nNode* root = new Node{1, new Node{2, new Node{4, nullptr, nullptr}, new Node{5, nullptr, nullptr}}, new Node{3, nullptr, nullptr}};\nif (isBalanced(root)) {\n  std::cout << \"The binary tree is balanced\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n  std::cout << \"The binary tree is not balanced\" << std::endl;\n}\n1\ntakeuforward\n2\ntechiedelight\n3\ngeeksforgeeks\n4\ndigitalocean\n5\nprogramiz"

The TrieNode class represents a node in the Trie data structure and has two fields: children, which is an unordered map that maps characters to child nodes, and isEndOfWord, which is a boolean flag that indicates whether the node represents the end of a word. The Trie class represents the Trie data structure and has three methods: insert(), search(), and startsWith(). The insert() method inserts a word into the Trie data structure by traversing the Trie and creating new nodes as necessary. The search() method searches for a word in the Trie data structure by traversing the Trie and checking if the final node represents the end of a word. The startsWith() method checks if a prefix exists in the Trie data structure by traversing the Trie and checking if all the characters in the prefix exist in the Trie.\nThe main() function creates a Trie object, inserts some words into the Trie, and performs some searches and prefix checks using the search() and startsWith() methods.\nFor example, the following code creates a Trie, inserts some words, and performs some searches and prefix checks:\nc++\nTrie trie;\ntrie.insert(\"apple\");\nstd::cout << trie.search(\"apple\") << std::endl;   // prints 1\nstd::cout << trie.search(\"app\") << std::endl;     // prints 0\nstd::cout << trie.startsWith(\"app\") << std::endl; // prints 1\ntrie.insert(\"app\");\nstd::cout << trie.search(\"app\") << std::endl;     // prints 1\n1\nscaler\n2\nleetcode"

The addEdge() method adds an edge between two nodes in the graph. The dfs() method performs a depth-first search on the graph starting from a given node by maintaining a visited set and a stack. The method starts by pushing the start node onto the stack and then repeatedly pops a node from the stack, marks it as visited, prints it, and pushes its unvisited neighbors onto the stack.\nThe main() function creates a Graph object, adds some edges to the graph, and performs a depth-first search starting from node 0 using the dfs() method.\nFor example, the following code creates a graph, adds some edges, and performs a depth-first search starting from node 0:\nc++\nGraph graph(4);\ngraph.addEdge(0, 1);\ngraph.addEdge(0, 2);\ngraph.addEdge(1, 2);\ngraph.addEdge(2, 3);\ngraph.dfs(0);\n1\ngeeksforgeeks\n2\nprogramiz\n3\njavatpoint"

Here's a Java implementation of this method:\njava\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Anagram {\n    public static boolean isAnagram(String s1, String s2) {\n        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        char[] charArray1 = s1.toCharArray();\n        char[] charArray2 = s2.toCharArray();\n        Arrays.sort(charArray1);\n        Arrays.sort(charArray2);\n        return Arrays.equals(charArray1, charArray2);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(isAnagram(\"listen\", \"silent\"));  // true\n        System.out.println(isAnagram(\"hello\", \"world\"));  // false\n    }\n}\nIn conclusion, there are several ways to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. We can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the strings, use the Counter class from the collections module in Python, or sort the strings and compare them.\n1\ngeekbits\n2\ngeeksforgeeks\n3\nprogramiz\n4\nprepinsta\n5\nenjoyalgorithms"

Like binary min-heaps and max-heaps, min-max heaps support logarithmic insertion and deletion and can be built in linear time. Min-max heaps are often represented implicitly in an array. The min-max heap property is that each node at an even level in the tree is less than all of its descendants, while each node at an odd level in the tree is greater than all of its descendants\n1\n.\nTo implement a min-max heap, we can use an array to store the data.

For any given node at position i, its left child is at [2i] if available, its right child is at [2i+1] if available, and its parent node is at [i/2] if available.

It is used to find the shortest path between a singled-out source node and the other nodes of the graph. The algorithm works by building a set of nodes that have a minimum distance from the source. The algorithm uses a data structure for storing and querying partial solutions sorted by distance from the start. Dijkstra's original algorithm does not use a min-priority queue and runs in time (where is the number of nodes)\n1\n2\n.\nTo implement Dijkstra's algorithm, we can use a priority queue to store the nodes that have not yet been visited, sorted by their distance from the source node. We start by initializing the distance of the source node to 0 and the distance of all other nodes to infinity.

The function initializes the distances of all nodes to infinity except for the source node, which is initialized to 0. It uses a priority queue to store the nodes that have not yet been visited, sorted by their distance from the source node. It also keeps track of the previous node in the shortest path from the source node to each node. The function visits the node with the smallest distance from the source node and updates the distances of its neighbors. It repeats this process until it has visited all nodes or until the destination node is reached. Finally, it constructs the shortest path from the source node to the destination node by backtracking from the destination node to the source node using the previous node in the path.\nFor example, the following code creates a graph, finds the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm, and prints the result:\npython\ngraph = {\n    'A': {'B': 2, 'C': 3},\n    'B': {'A': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1},\n    'C': {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'D': 4},\n    'D': {'B': 1, 'C': 4}\n}\nsource = 'A'\ndestination = 'D'\npath = dijkstra(graph, source, destination)\nprint(path)  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'D']\nIn conclusion, we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue to store the nodes that have not yet been visited, sorted by their distance from the source node. We can initialize the distances of all nodes to infinity except for the source node, which is initialized to 0. We can then visit the node with the smallest distance from the source node and update the distances of its neighbors. We repeat this process until we have visited all nodes or until the destination node is reached. We can also keep track of the shortest path from the source node to each node by storing the previous"

This can be done by creating a new array of size m+n, where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays, and then merging the two arrays into the new array. We can then find the median of the merged array by taking the average of the middle two elements if the total length of the merged array is even, or by taking the middle element if the total length is odd.

Instead, they use a bit array that allows hash collisions. The choice of hash function used in Bloom filters should be independent and uniformly distributed. They should also be as fast as possible.

        "Output": "Radix sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and value (place value). Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort an array of numbers. The algorithm sorts the elements by processing them in multiple passes, digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD) or vice versa. Radix sort can incorporate different sorting algorithms to sort digits of the same place value. Radix sort runs in O(d*(n+b)) time, where d is the number of digits, n is the number of elements, and b is the base of the number system used to represent the elements.\nThe basic idea of radix sort is to sort the elements by their digits, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. In each pass, the elements are sorted into buckets based on the value of the current digit, and then the buckets are concatenated in order to form the sorted list. The algorithm repeats this process for each digit until all digits have been considered. Radix sort can be implemented using LSD radix sort or MSD radix sort. LSD radix sort starts the sorting from the least significant digit and employs a stable sorting algorithm as a subroutine to sort digits of the same place value. MSD radix sort starts the sorting from the most significant digit and recursively performs bucket sort to sort digits of the same place value.\nHere is an example implementation of LSD radix sort in Python:\npython\ndef radix_sort_lsd(arr):\n    max_value = max(arr)\n    exp = 1\n    while max_value // exp > 0:\n        buckets = [[] for _ in range(10)]\n        for num in arr:\n            digit = (num // exp) % 10\n            buckets[digit].append(num)\n        arr = [num for bucket in buckets for num in bucket]\n        exp *= 10\n    return arr\nIn this implementation, the radix_sort_lsd() function takes an array of integers as input and uses LSD radix sort to sort the array. The function starts by finding the maximum value in the array to determine the number of digits in the largest number. It then iterates over each digit, starting from the least significant digit, and uses bucket sort to sort the elements into buckets based on the value of the current digit. Finally, the function concatenates the buckets in order to form the sorted list.\nFor example, the following code sorts an array of integers using LSD radix sort:\npython\narr = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\nsorted_arr = radix_sort_lsd(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)\nThis will output:\n[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]\nIn conclusion, radix sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and value (place value).

        "Output": "A segment tree is a data structure used to store information about intervals or segments of an array. It allows us to perform range queries and updates on the array in logarithmic time complexity. A segment tree is essentially a binary tree in whose nodes we store the information about the segments of a linear data structure such as an array. The root of the tree represents the entire array, and each node represents a segment of the array. The segment tree works on the principle of divide and conquer. At each level, we divide the array segments into two parts. If the given array had [0, . . ., N-1] elements in it then the two parts of the array will be [0, . . ., N/2-1] and [N/2, . . ., N-1]. We will then recursively go on until the lower and upper bounds of the range become equal. The structure of the segment tree looks like a binary tree. The segment tree can be used to solve various problems such as range sum, range minimum/maximum query, and range update.\nHere is an example implementation of a segment tree in Python for range sum query:\npython\nclass SegmentTree:\n    def __init__(self, nums):\n        self.nums = nums\n        self.tree = [0] * (4 * len(nums))\n        self.build(0, 0, len(nums) - 1)\n\n    def build(self, node, start, end):\n        if start == end:\n            self.tree[node] = self.nums[start]\n        else:\n            mid = (start + end) // 2\n            self.build(2 * node + 1, start, mid)\n            self.build(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end)\n            self.tree[node] = self.tree[2 * node + 1] + self.tree[2 * node + 2]\n\n    def query(self, node, start, end, left, right):\n        if left > end or right < start:\n            return 0\n        if left <= start and right >= end:\n            return self.tree[node]\n        mid = (start + end) // 2\n        return self.query(2 * node + 1, start, mid, left, right) + self.query(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, left, right)\n\n    def update(self, node, start, end, index, val):\n        if start == end:\n            self.nums[index] = val\n            self.tree[node] = val\n        else:\n            mid = (start + end) // 2\n            if index >= start and index <= mid:\n                self.update(2 * node + 1, start, mid, index, val)\n            else:\n                self.update(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, index, val)\n            self.tree[node] = self.tree[2 * node + 1] + self.tree[2 * node + 2]\nIn this implementation, the SegmentTree class takes an array of integers as input and builds a segment tree for range sum query. The class uses an array to store the segment tree and defines three methods: build(), query(), and update(). The build() method recursively builds the segment tree by dividing the array into two parts and computing the sum of the segments. The query() method recursively queries the segment tree to find the sum of the elements in the given range. The update() method updates the value of an element in the array and updates the segment tree accordingly.\nFor example, the following code creates a segment tree for an array of integers and performs range sum queries:\npython\nnums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\ntree = SegmentTree(nums)\n\nprint(tree.query(0, 0, len(nums) - 1, 1, 3)) # Output: 15\n\ntree.update(0, 0, len(nums) - 1, 2, 6)\n\nprint(tree.query(0, 0, len(nums) - 1, 1, 3)) # Output: 16\nThis will output:\n15\n16\nIn conclusion, a segment tree is a data structure used to store information about intervals or segments of an array. It allows us to perform range queries and updates on the array in logarithmic time complexity. We can implement a segment tree using a binary tree in whose nodes we store the information about the segments of a linear data structure such as an array. We can use a segment tree to solve various problems such as range sum, range minimum/maximum query, and range update.\n1\nenjoyalgorithms\n2\ncp-algorithms\n3\nbaeldung\n4\nwikipedia\n5\ngeeksforgeeks"

The function builds an adjacency list representation of the graph and uses a set to keep track of visited nodes and a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node. The function then performs DFS on the graph and checks for cycles by verifying that the parent of each visited node is not its neighbor. If a cycle is found, the function returns False.

Otherwise, the function returns True if all nodes are visited.\nFor example, the following code checks if a given graph is a tree using both implementations:\npython\nn = 5\nedges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 4)]\nprint(is_tree(n, edges)) # Output: True\n\nn = 5\nedges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)]\nprint(is_tree(n, edges)) # Output: False\nThis will output:\nTrue\nFalse\nIn conclusion, to check if a given graph is a tree, we need to verify that the graph has no cycles and is connected. We can implement this using DFS or BFS to traverse the graph and check for cycles and connectivity. If the graph satisfies both properties, then it is a tree.

Its name derives from the fact that the Fibonacci sequence is used in the complexity analysis of its operations\n1\n2\n3\n.\nA Fibonacci heap is a collection of heap-ordered trees. They do not need to be binomial trees, however, this is where the relaxation of some of the binomial heap’s properties comes in. Each tree has an order just like the binomial heap that is based on the number of children. Nodes within a Fibonacci heap can be removed from their tree without restructuring them, so the order does not necessarily indicate the maximum height of the tree or number of nodes it contains. The pointers between nodes in a Fibonacci heap are very similar to that of a doubly linked list\n1\n.\nThe Fibonacci heap is called a Fibonacci heap because the trees are constructed in a way such that a tree of order n has at least Fn+2 nodes in it, where Fn+2 is the (n + 2)th Fibonacci number.

Topological sort is only applicable to DAGs because a cycle in the graph would make it impossible to find a valid ordering. There are several algorithms to perform topological sort, including DFS-based and BFS-based algorithms.\nOne common algorithm for topological sort is Kahn's algorithm, which uses the in-degree of each vertex to determine the order in which vertices should be processed. The algorithm works as follows:\nCompute the in-degree of each vertex in the graph.\nInitialize a queue with all vertices that have an in-degree of 0.\nWhile the queue is not empty, remove a vertex from the queue and add it to the sorted list.\nFor each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrement its in-degree. If the in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\nIf the sorted list contains all vertices in the graph, return the list as the topological order. Otherwise, the graph has a cycle and no valid topological order exists.\nHere is an example implementation of Kahn's algorithm in Python:\npython\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef topological_sort(n, edges):\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    in_degree = [0] * n\n    for u, v in edges:\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        in_degree[v] += 1\n\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if in_degree[i] == 0])\n    result = []\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        result.append(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n\n    if len(result) != n:\n        return None\n    return result\nIn this implementation, the topological_sort() function takes an integer n and a list of edges as input and uses Kahn's algorithm to perform topological sort on the graph.

The suffix array is closely related to the suffix tree, which is a compressed trie of all the suffixes of a given text. The suffix array can be used to perform various operations such as construction, searching, longest common prefix, counting distinct substrings, etc. Some real-world applications of suffix arrays include databases, bioinformatics, and text processing.\nThere are several algorithms to construct a suffix array, including the naive algorithm and the O(n log n) algorithm. The naive algorithm considers all suffixes, sorts them using a O(n log n) sorting algorithm, and maintains the original indexes. The time complexity of the naive algorithm is O(n^2 log n), where n is the number of characters in the input string. The O(n log n) algorithm for suffix array construction is based on the idea of sorting suffixes by their first k characters, where k is a power of 2. The algorithm sorts suffixes by their first 2^i characters for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., log n, using radix sort or counting sort.\nHere is an example implementation of the O(n log n) algorithm for suffix array construction in Python:\npython\ndef suffix_array(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    sa = [i for i in range(n)]\n    rank = [ord(s[i]) for i in range(n)]\n    k = 1\n    while k < n:\n        sa = sorted(sa, key=lambda i: (rank[i], rank[i + k] if i + k < n else -1))\n        rank = [rank[sa[i]] if i > 0 and rank[sa[i]] == rank[sa[i - 1]] and rank[sa[i] + k] == rank[sa[i - 1] + k] else i for i in range(n)]\n        k *= 2\n    return sa\nIn this implementation, the suffix_array() function takes a string s as input and uses the O(n log n) algorithm to construct the suffix array.

The function then iteratively sorts the suffix array by their first 2^i characters for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., log n, using the sorted() function with a key function that compares the ranks of the suffixes. The function updates the rank array based on the sorted suffix array and the previous rank array.

We can define the curving point as the node on the diameter path which has the maximum height. For each node, we can calculate the height of its left and right subtrees and add them together to get the diameter of the node. We can then traverse the entire binary tree and find the maximum diameter among all nodes. The time complexity of the naive approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.\nThe optimized approach using dynamic programming involves calculating the height of each node in the binary tree and storing it in an array.

The get_height() function recursively calculates the height of a node by calculating the height of its left and right subtrees and storing the result in the height dictionary. The get_diameter() function recursively calculates the diameter of a node by calculating the diameter of its left and right subtrees and the diameter of the node itself using the height dictionary.

Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it. In computer science and computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with various algorithms. In some cases, the algorithm's basic operations are tightly coupled to the data structure's design. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data, and -- in some cases -- functions that can be applied to the data. Typical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer programming languages can be used to create more complex data structures. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. Linear data structures and non-linear data structures are the two main categories of data structures.

This means that arrays require a fixed amount of memory to be allocated, even if not all of it is being used, while linked lists can increase their sizes step-by-step proportionately to the amount of data.\nAccess time: Any element in an array can be directly accessed with its index, which makes accessing elements in an array faster than in a linked list. However, in the case of a linked list, all the previous elements must be traversed to reach any element.\nInsertion and deletion: Insertion and deletion of elements in an array can be time-consuming, especially if the array is large, because all the elements after the insertion or deletion point must be shifted. In contrast, insertion and deletion of elements in a linked list are fast because only the pointers need to be updated.\nMemory usage: Arrays require a fixed amount of memory to be allocated, even if not all of it is being used, while linked lists can increase their sizes step-by-step proportionately to the amount of data.

A queue has two ends, front and rear, and new elements are added to the rear end and removed from the front end. Queues are used in many applications, such as job scheduling, network packet routing, and breadth-first search algorithms.\nHere is an example of how a queue can be used to implement a printer queue. Suppose we have a printer that can print one document at a time, and multiple users want to print their documents. We can use a queue to manage the printing requests. Each time a user wants to print a document, we can add the document to the rear end of the queue. The printer can then remove the document from the front end of the queue and print it. This ensures that the documents are printed in the order they were requested, following the FIFO principle.\npython\nclass PrinterQueue:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.queue = []\n\n    def add_document(self, document):\n        self.queue.append(document)\n\n    def print_document(self):\n        if not self.queue:\n            print(\"No documents to print\")\n        else:\n            document = self.queue.pop(0)\n            print(\"Printing document:\", document)\n\nprinter_queue = PrinterQueue()\nprinter_queue.add_document(\"Document 1\")\nprinter_queue.add_document(\"Document 2\")\nprinter_queue.add_document(\"Document 3\")\nprinter_queue.print_document()\nprinter_queue.print_document()\nprinter_queue.print_document()\nprinter_queue.print_document()\nThis will output:\nPrinting document: Document 1\nPrinting document: Document 2\nPrinting document: Document 3\nNo documents to print\nIn this example, we first create a PrinterQueue class that has an internal list to store the documents. We then add three documents to the queue using the add_document() method, and print them using the print_document() method. The print_document() method removes the document from the front end of the queue using the pop(0) method and prints it. If there are no documents in the queue, it prints a message saying \"No documents to print\".\nIn conclusion, a queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. It is used in many applications, such as job scheduling, network packet routing, and breadth-first search algorithms. We can use a queue to implement a printer queue by adding documents to the rear end of the queue and removing them from the front end of the queue in the order they were requested.\n1\ngeeksforgeeks\n2\neverythingcomputerscience\n3\nfavtutor\n4\nstudytonight\n5\ntutorialspoint"

Binary trees are used in many applications, such as searching and sorting algorithms, expression evaluation, and file systems.\nThere are several types of binary trees, including:\nFull binary tree: A full binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.\nPerfect binary tree: A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.\nComplete binary tree: A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences - every level must be completely filled, and all the leaf elements must lean towards the left.\nBinary trees can be implemented using a node structure that contains a key, a left child pointer, and a right child pointer.

The array is used to store the key-value pairs, and the hash function is used to compute the index of the array where the key-value pair will be stored.

A Fenwick tree is typically implemented as an array and is indexed using bits of integer keys. These integer keys fall in range [1...n], skipping 0. The Fenwick tree is most easily understood by considering a one-based array with elements. The corresponding Fenwick tree has nodes with an implicit node 0 at the root. Each level of the tree contains nodes with indices corresponding to sums of distinct powers of 2 (with 0 representing an empty sum 0). The parent of a given node can be found by clearing the last set bit (LSB) in its index, corresponding to the smallest power of 2 in its sum. Fenwick tree is mostly used when we have been given an array and we need to answer multiple getSum queries finding the sum of first elements many times or/and we need to find the sum of a range of elements many times, and also we need to perform multiple update operations updating the value of at any particular index. Fenwick tree is easy to use and code, especially in the case of multidimensional arrays. Compared to the segment tree data structure, Fenwick tree uses less space and is simpler to implement.

The positions of each suffix in the text string T are recorded as integer indices at the leaves of the suffix tree, whereas the path labels (concatenation of edge labels starting from the root) of the leaves describe the suffixes. Suffix trees help in solving a lot of string-related problems like pattern matching, substring search, and finding the longest repeated substring. Suffix trees are used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems.

It allows us to modify the array by replacing an element or an entire range of elements in logarithmic time. Fenwick tree is mostly used when we have been given an array and we need to answer multiple getSum queries finding the sum of first elements many times or/and we need to find the sum of a range of elements many times, and also we need to perform multiple update operations updating the value of at any particular index. Fenwick tree is easy to use and code, especially in the case of multidimensional arrays. Compared to the segment tree data structure, Fenwick tree uses less space and is simpler to implement. One disadvantage of Fenwick tree is that it can be only used with an operation that is invertible. For example, addition is an invertible operation: if a + b = c then c - a = b (where - acts as inverse of addition).\nIn conclusion, a suffix tree is a tree-based data structure used to store and search for substrings in a string.

        "Output": "A suffix array is a sorted array of all the suffixes of a given string. It is a data structure used to store and search for substrings in a string. The definition is similar to a suffix tree, which is a compressed trie of all suffixes of the given text. Any suffix tree-based algorithm can be replaced with an algorithm that uses a suffix array enhanced with additional information and solves the same problem in the same time complexity. A suffix array can be constructed from a suffix tree by doing a DFS traversal of the suffix tree. In fact, a suffix array and suffix tree both can be constructed from each other in linear time. Suffix arrays help in solving a lot of string-related problems like pattern matching, substring search, and finding the longest repeated substring.

        "Output": "A disjoint-set data structure, also known as a union-find data structure or merge-find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set. Disjoint-set data structures play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The importance of minimum spanning trees means that disjoint-set data structures underlie a wide variety of algorithms. In addition, disjoint-set data structures also have applications to symbolic computation, as well as in compilers, especially for register allocation problems. A disjoint-set is a data structure that keeps track of a universe of elements. The items are partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:\nAdding new sets to the disjoint set.\nMerging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.\nFinding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.\nCheck if two sets are disjoint or not.\nDisjoint-set data structures are used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems.

        "Input": "What is a skip list?",
        "Output": "A skip list is a probabilistic data structure used for storing a sorted list of items with the help of a hierarchy of linked lists that connect increasingly sparse subsequences of the items. It allows the process of item lookup in an efficient manner. The skip list is an extended version of the linked list. It allows the user to search, remove, and insert the element very quickly. It consists of a base list that includes a set of elements which maintains the link hierarchy of the subsequent elements. A skip list is built in layers, with the bottom layer being an ordinary ordered linked list. Each higher layer acts as an \"express lane\" for the lists below, where an element in layer i appears in layer i+1 with some fixed probability. On average, each element appears in log n lists, and the tallest element (usually a special head element at the front of the skip list) appears in all the lists. Skip lists are relatively easy to implement, especially when compared to balanced trees like AVL Trees or Red Black Trees. They are balanced by consulting a random number generator, which determines how many pointers called node level to successive elements a node will have. Skip lists are used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems. They are designed to minimize the number of comparisons required to retrieve or modify data, making them well-suited for use in applications that require fast access to large amounts of data.\n1\njavatpoint\n2\nreachsumit\n3\nbaeldung\n4\nstackexchange\n5\nwikipedia"

        "Output": "A self-balancing binary search tree is a binary search tree that automatically keeps its height small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions. It is a node-based binary search tree that contains precautionary measures against boundlessly increasing tree height, so that these abstract data structures receive the attribute \"self-balancing\". Most operations on a binary search tree take time directly proportional to the height of the tree, so it is desirable to keep the height small. A binary tree with height h can contain at most 2^(h+1)-1 nodes. Self-balancing binary search trees provide efficient implementations for mutable ordered lists, and can be used for other abstract data structures such as associative arrays, priority queues, and sets. There are several types of self-balancing binary search trees, such as AVL trees, red-black trees, splay trees, and treaps. These trees always keep their height to a minimum, ensuring that their operations will always maintain a worst-case cost of O(log n). Self-balancing binary search trees are used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems.

It is a linear data structure that collectively represents a sequence of data in which each node has three parts. The previous pointer of the first node and the next pointer of the last node always contain null indicating the end in each direction. A doubly linked list allows navigation in both forward and backward directions, making it more flexible than a singly linked list. It is used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems. The advantages of a doubly linked list include constant time insertion and deletion of elements, as well as the ability to traverse the list in both directions. The disadvantages include the extra space required for the previous pointer and the complexity of the implementation compared to a singly linked list. Overall, a doubly linked list is a useful data structure for situations where frequent insertion and deletion of elements are required, and where traversal in both directions is necessary.\n1\nprogramiz\n2\njavatpoint\n3\nwikipedia\n4\nprocoding\n5\ntutorialspoint"

        "Output": "A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which all nodes are connected to form a circle. Unlike a traditional linked list, there is no NULL at the end of the list. Instead, the last node points to the first node, creating a circular structure. Circular linked lists are typically implemented using a singly linked list data structure, where each node in the list is connected to the next node via a pointer. The last node in the list is then connected back to the first node, creating the ring-like structure. There are two types of circular linked lists: singly linked and doubly linked. In a singly linked circular linked list, each node has a pointer that points to the next node in the list. In a doubly linked circular linked list, each node has a pointer that points to both the next and the previous nodes in the list.\nCircular linked lists are useful in situations where data needs to be processed in a continuous loop, such as in real-time applications or simulations. They are also used in multi-player games, where all the players are arranged in a circular linked list form. The advantages of a circular linked list include the ability to traverse the entire list without having to keep track of the end of the list, and the ability to go to any node from any node in the list. The disadvantages include the complexity of the implementation compared to a singly linked list, and the possibility of going into an infinite loop while traversing the list if the loop is not broken properly.\n1\nprepbytes\n2\nstudocu\n3\nbtechsmartclass\n4\nsimplilearn\n5\ntechvidvan"

        "Output": "A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer. It is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, meaning it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list. The first node is called the head; it points to the first node of the list and helps us access every other element in the list. The last node, also sometimes called the tail, points to NULL which helps us in determining when the list ends. Singly linked lists allow the traversal of data only in one way. Singly linked lists are used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems. They are designed to minimize the number of comparisons required to retrieve or modify data, making them well-suited for use in applications that require fast access to large amounts of data.

The bits can be 0 or 1 only. Each bit in the bit array is independent, and as each bit can have 2 values, it can represent 2^n values where n is the number of bits in the array. A bit array is a mapping from some domain (almost always a range of integers) to values in the set {0, 1}. The values can be interpreted as dark/light, absent/present, locked/unlocked, valid/invalid, and so on. Because of their compactness, bit arrays have a number of applications in areas where space or efficiency is at a premium. Most commonly, they are used to implement a simple set data structure. Bit arrays are effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly. They are used in many applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems.

The main idea of a sparse table is to precompute all answers for range queries with power of two length. When we answer a range query on a sparse table, we can first split it into power-of-two sub-ranges. Then, we look up the precomputed answers and combine them into our final answer.

Some common operations that can be performed on a sparse table include construction, precomputation, and range queries.
