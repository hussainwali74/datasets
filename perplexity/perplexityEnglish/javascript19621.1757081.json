        "Output": "To implement a stack using a linked list in TypeScript, we can define a Node class that represents a node in the linked list, and a Stack class that uses this node class to implement the stack. The Stack class should have a top attribute that points to the top of the stack (i.e., the first node in the linked list). To push an item onto the stack, we create a new node with the given item and set its next pointer to the current top of the stack. We then set the top of the stack to the new node, effectively making it the new top of the stack. To pop an item from the stack, we simply remove the first node from the linked list by setting the top of the stack to the next node in the list (i.e., the node pointed to by the current top)\n1\n.\nHere's an example implementation of a stack using a linked list in TypeScript:\ntypescript\nclass Node<T> {\n  data: T;\n  next: Node<T> | null;\n\n  constructor(data: T) {\n    this.data = data;\n    this.next = null;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Stack<T> {\n  top: Node<T> | null;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.top = null;\n  }\n\n  push(data: T): void {\n    const node = new Node(data);\n    node.next = this.top;\n    this.top = node;\n  }\n\n  pop(): T | null {\n    if (!this.top) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    const data = this.top.data;\n    this.top = this.top.next;\n    return data;\n  }\n\n  peek(): T | null {\n    if (!this.top) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    return this.top.data;\n  }\n\n  isEmpty(): boolean {\n    return this.top === null;\n  }\n\n  size(): number {\n    let count = 0;\n    let current = this.top;\n    while (current) {\n      count++;\n      current = current.next;\n    }\n    return count;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst stack = new Stack<number>();\nstack.push(1);\nstack.push(2);\nstack.push(3);\nconsole.log(stack.pop()); // 3\nconsole.log(stack.peek()); // 2\nconsole.log(stack.isEmpty()); // false\nconsole.log(stack.size()); // 2\nIn this example, we define a Node class with a data attribute and a next attribute that points to the next node in the linked list. We also define a Stack class with a top attribute that points to the top of the stack. The push() method creates a new node with the given data and sets its next pointer to the current top of the stack. The pop() method removes the top node from the stack and returns its data. The peek() method returns the data of the top node without removing it. The isEmpty() method checks if the stack is empty. The size() method returns the number of nodes in the stack. Finally, we create a new Stack instance, push some values onto it, and call some of its methods to demonstrate its functionality.\n1\ngeeksforgeeks"

The function should first check if the node is null, in which case the height is 0. Otherwise, it should recursively compute the heights of the left and right subtrees, and check if they are balanced and their absolute difference is less than or equal to 1.

We also define a isBalanced function that takes a TreeNode instance as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the tree rooted at that node is a balanced binary search tree. The isBalanced function calls a nested getHeight function that takes a TreeNode instance as an argument and returns the height of the subtree rooted at that node, or -1 if the subtree is unbalanced. The getHeight function first checks if the node is null, in which case the height is 0. Otherwise, it recursively computes the heights of the left and right subtrees, and checks if they are balanced and their absolute difference is less than or equal to 1. If both subtrees are balanced, the function returns the height of the subtree rooted at the current node, which is the maximum of the heights of its left and right subtrees plus 1. If either subtree is unbalanced, the function returns -1 to indicate that the entire tree is unbalanced. Finally, the isBalanced function returns true if the height of the root node is not -1, indicating that the entire tree is balanced, and false otherwise.\n1\ndigitalocean"

        "Output": "There are several resources available for implementing a min-max heap data structure in TypeScript. One approach is to use a binary heap, which is a tree-like data structure that satisfies the heap property\n1\n. A binary heap can be implemented as an array, where the root of the tree is at index 0, and the left and right children of a node at index i are at indices 2i+1 and 2i+2, respectively.\nTo implement a min-max heap, we can use the binary heap array to store both the minimum and maximum elements of the heap. Specifically, we can store the minimum elements in the odd indices of the array (1, 3, 5, etc.), and the maximum elements in the even indices of the array (0, 2, 4, etc.). This allows us to efficiently access both the minimum and maximum elements of the heap, and to maintain the heap property by swapping elements as needed during insertions and deletions\n2\n.\nHere's an example implementation of a min-max heap data structure using a binary heap array in TypeScript:\ntypescript\nclass MinMaxHeap<T> {\n  private heap: T[] = [];\n\n  private getParentIndex(index: number): number {\n    return Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);\n  }\n\n  private getMinChildIndex(index: number): number {\n    const leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;\n    const rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;\n    if (leftChildIndex >= this.heap.length) {\n      return -1;\n    }\n    if (rightChildIndex >= this.heap.length) {\n      return leftChildIndex;\n    }\n    return this.heap[leftChildIndex] < this.heap[rightChildIndex] ? leftChildIndex : rightChildIndex;\n  }\n\n  private getMaxChildIndex(index: number): number {\n    const leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;\n    const rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;\n    if (leftChildIndex >= this.heap.length) {\n      return -1;\n    }\n    if (rightChildIndex >= this.heap.length) {\n      return leftChildIndex;\n    }\n    return this.heap[leftChildIndex] > this.heap[rightChildIndex] ? leftChildIndex : rightChildIndex;\n  }\n\n  private bubbleUp(index: number): void {\n    const isMinLevel = Math.floor(Math.log2(index + 1)) % 2 === 0;\n    if (index === 0 || (isMinLevel && this.heap[index] >= this.heap[this.getParentIndex(index)]) ||\n        (!isMinLevel && this.heap[index] <= this.heap[this.getParentIndex(index)])) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const parentIndex = this.getParentIndex(index);\n    const temp = this.heap[index];\n    this.heap[index] = this.heap[parentIndex];\n    this.heap[parentIndex] = temp;\n    this.bubbleUp(parentIndex);\n  }\n\n  private bubbleDown(index: number): void {\n    const isMinLevel = Math.floor(Math.log2(index + 1)) % 2 === 0;\n    const minChildIndex = this.getMinChildIndex(index);\n    const maxChildIndex = this.getMaxChildIndex(index);\n    if (minChildIndex === -1) {\n      return;\n    }\n    let targetChildIndex = minChildIndex;\n    if (!isMinLevel && maxChildIndex !== -1 && this.heap[maxChildIndex] > this.heap[minChildIndex]) {\n      targetChildIndex = maxChildIndex;\n    }\n    if ((isMinLevel && this.heap[index] <= this.heap[targetChildIndex]) ||\n        (!isMinLevel && this.heap[index] >= this.heap[targetChildIndex])) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const temp = this.heap[index];\n    this.heap[index] = this.heap[targetChildIndex];\n    this.heap[targetChildIndex] = temp;\n    this.bubbleDown(targetChildIndex);\n  }\n\n  insert(item: T): void {\n    this.heap.push(item);\n    this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);\n  }\n\n  deleteMin(): T | undefined {\n    if (this.heap.length === 0) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    const min = this.heap[0];\n    this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop()!;\n    this.bubbleDown(0);\n    return min;\n  }\n\n  deleteMax(): T | undefined {\n    if (this.heap.length === 0) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    const maxIndex = this.heap[1] > this.heap[2] ? 1 : 2;\n    const max = this.heap[maxIndex];\n    this.heap[maxIndex] = this.heap.pop()!;\n    this.bubbleDown(maxIndex);\n    return max;\n  }\n\n  getMin(): T | undefined {\n    return this.heap.length > 0 ? this.heap[0] : undefined;\n  }\n\n  getMax(): T | undefined {\n    return this.heap.length > 1 ?

        "Output": "To find the longest common subsequence between two strings in TypeScript, we can use dynamic programming to solve the problem in O(mn) time, where m and n are the lengths of the two strings\n1\n2\n. The basic idea is to create a two-dimensional array dp of size (m+1) x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string. We can then fill in the array dp using the following recurrence relation:\ndp[i][j] = 0, if i = 0 or j = 0\ndp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, if s1[i-1] = s2[j-1]\ndp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), otherwise\nHere, s1 and s2 are the two input strings, and max() is a function that returns the maximum of its two arguments. The first case represents the base case, where the length of the longest common subsequence is 0 if either of the strings is empty. The second case represents the case where the last characters of both strings match, in which case we can extend the longest common subsequence by 1. The third case represents the case where the last characters of both strings do not match, in which case we need to choose the maximum of the lengths of the longest common subsequences of the two strings with the last character of one string removed.\nOnce we have filled in the dp array, we can reconstruct the longest common subsequence by starting at dp[m][n] and following the path of maximum values in the array, using the recurrence relation:\nif s1[i-1] = s2[j-1], add s1[i-1] to the result and move diagonally to dp[i-1][j-1]\notherwise, move to the adjacent cell with the maximum value: if dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1], move to dp[i-1][j], otherwise move to dp[i][j-1]\nHere's an example implementation of a function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming in TypeScript:\ntypescript\nfunction longestCommonSubsequence(s1: string, s2: string): string {\n  const m = s1.length;\n  const n = s2.length;\n  const dp: number[][] = new Array(m + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));\n  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n      if (s1[i-1] === s2[j-1]) {\n        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;\n      } else {\n        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  let i = m;\n  let j = n;\n  const result: string[] = [];\n  while (i > 0 && j > 0) {\n    if (s1[i-1] === s2[j-1]) {\n      result.unshift(s1[i-1]);\n      i--;\n      j--;\n    } else if (dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]) {\n      i--;\n    } else {\n      j--;\n    }\n  }\n  return result.join('');\n}\nIn this example, we define a longestCommonSubsequence function that takes two strings as arguments and returns a string representing the longest common subsequence between the two strings. The function first initializes a two-dimensional array dp of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings, and fills in the array using the dynamic programming recurrence relation. It then reconstructs the longest common subsequence by following the path of maximum values in the dp array, and returns the result as a string.\nHere's an example usage of the longestCommonSubsequence function:\ntypescript\nconst s1 = 'ABCDGH';\nconst s2 = 'AEDFHR';\nconst lcs = longestCommonSubsequence(s1, s2);\nconsole.log(lcs); // 'ADH'\nIn this example, we create two new strings s1 and s2 with the values 'ABCDGH' and 'AEDFHR', respectively. We then call the longestCommonSubsequence function with s1 and s2 as the arguments and assign the result to a new variable lcs. Finally, we log the value of lcs to the console, which should be 'ADH'.\n1\nleetcode\n2\ngeeksforgeeks"

Here's an example implementation:\ntypescript\nfunction findMedianSortedArrays(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {\n  const merged = [...nums1, ...nums2].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const n = merged.length;\n  if (n % 2 === 0) {\n    return (merged[n/2 - 1] + merged[n/2]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    return merged[(n-1)/2];\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a findMedianSortedArrays function that takes two sorted arrays as arguments and returns the median of the merged array. The function first concatenates the two arrays using the spread operator (...), sorts the resulting array using the sort() method with a comparison function that sorts in ascending order, and then calculates the median of the merged array using the length of the array and the appropriate formula.\nBinary Search: Another approach is to use binary search to find the median of the two sorted arrays. This approach is more efficient than the merge and sort approach, with a time complexity of O(log(min(m, n))), where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays.

The function first checks if the length of the first array is greater than the length of the second array, and if so, swaps the arrays to ensure that the first array is always the shorter one. The function then uses binary search to find the partition points of the two arrays, such that the left half of the merged array contains all the elements that are less than or equal to the right half of the merged array. The function then calculates the median of the merged array using the partition points and the appropriate formula.\nThese are just a few examples of how to find the median of two sorted arrays in TypeScript. There are other approaches as well, such as using heaps or divide and conquer algorithms.

The traverse function is called with the root node as the argument, and the resulting result array is returned.\nHere's an example usage of the inorderTraversal function:\ntypescript\nconst root = new TreeNode(1);\nroot.right = new TreeNode(2);\nroot.right.left = new TreeNode(3);\nconst result = inorderTraversal(root);\nconsole.log(result); // [1, 3, 2]\nIn this example, we create a new binary tree with the root node value of 1, a right child node with a value of 2, and a left child node of the right child node with a value of 3. We then call the inorderTraversal function with the root node as the argument and assign the result to a new variable result. Finally, we log the value of result to the console, which should be [1][3][2].\n1\ncodegrepper\n2\nmaxinrui\n3\ngeeksforgeeks\n4\ndigitalocean\n5\nmydaytodo"

        "Output": "To implement a bloom filter data structure in TypeScript, we can use an existing library such as bloom-filters\n1\n2\n. This library provides a simple and efficient implementation of a bloom filter, as well as other probabilistic data structures such as HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch, Top-K, and MinHash.\nHere's an example usage of the bloom-filters library to create and use a bloom filter in TypeScript:\ntypescript\nimport { BloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters';\n\n// create a Bloom Filter with a size of 10 and 4 hash functions\nconst filter = new BloomFilter(10, 4);\n\n// insert data\nfilter.add('alice');\nfilter.add('bob');\n\n// lookup for some data\nconsole.log(filter.has('bob')); // output: true\nconsole.log(filter.has('daniel')); // output: false\n\n// print the error rate\nconsole.log(filter.rate());\n\n// alternatively, create a bloom filter optimal for a number of items and a desired error rate\nconst items = ['alice', 'bob'];\nconst errorRate = 0.04; // 4 % error rate\nconst filter2 = BloomFilter.create(items.length, errorRate);\n\n// or create a bloom filter optimal for a collections of items and a desired error rate\nconst filter3 = BloomFilter.from(items, errorRate);\nIn this example, we first import the BloomFilter class from the bloom-filters library. We then create a new bloom filter with a size of 10 and 4 hash functions, and insert some data into the filter. We then perform a lookup for some data and print the error rate of the filter. Finally, we create two more bloom filters, one optimal for a number of items and a desired error rate, and the other optimal for a collection of items and a desired error rate.\nAlternatively, we can implement our own bloom filter data structure using a bit array and multiple hash functions\n3\n. Here's an example implementation:\ntypescript\nclass BloomFilter {\n  private readonly bitArray: boolean[];\n  private readonly hashFunctions: ((value: string) => number)[];\n\n  constructor(size: number, hashFunctions: ((value: string) => number)[]) {\n    this.bitArray = new Array(size).fill(false);\n    this.hashFunctions = hashFunctions;\n  }\n\n  add(value: string) {\n    this.hashFunctions.forEach((hashFunction) => {\n      const index = hashFunction(value) % this.bitArray.length;\n      this.bitArray[index] = true;\n    });\n  }\n\n  has(value: string): boolean {\n    return this.hashFunctions.every((hashFunction) => {\n      const index = hashFunction(value) % this.bitArray.length;\n      return this.bitArray[index];\n    });\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a BloomFilter class that represents a bloom filter data structure, with a bitArray property for the bit array, and a hashFunctions property for the hash functions. We then define an add method that adds a value to the bloom filter by setting the corresponding bits in the bit array using the hash functions, and a has method that checks if a value is in the bloom filter by checking the corresponding bits in the bit array using the hash functions.\nHere's an example usage of the BloomFilter class:\ntypescript\nconst hashFunctions = [\n  (value: string) => value.length,\n  (value: string) => value.charCodeAt(0),\n  (value: string) => value.charCodeAt(value.length - 1),\n];\nconst filter = new BloomFilter(10, hashFunctions);\nfilter.add('alice');\nfilter.add('bob');\nconsole.log(filter.has('bob')); // output: true\nconsole.log(filter.has('daniel')); // output: false\nIn this example, we create a new BloomFilter object with a size of 10 and an array of three hash functions. We then add some data to the filter and perform a lookup for some data.\n1\ngithub\n2\nnpmjs\n3\nllimllib"

        "Output": "To generate all permutations of a given string in TypeScript, we can use a recursive approach that swaps each character with every other character in the string. Here are a few examples of how to implement this approach:\nUsing a helper function: One approach is to define a helper function that takes the current string, the starting index, and the ending index as arguments, and recursively swaps each character with every other character in the string. Here's an example implementation:\ntypescript\nfunction permuteHelper(str: string, start: number, end: number, result: string[]) {\n  if (start === end) {\n    result.push(str);\n  } else {\n    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n      str = swap(str, start, i);\n      permuteHelper(str, start + 1, end, result);\n      str = swap(str, start, i);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction swap(str: string, i: number, j: number): string {\n  const arr = str.split('');\n  [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];\n  return arr.join('');\n}\n\nfunction permute(str: string): string[] {\n  const result: string[] = [];\n  permuteHelper(str, 0, str.length - 1, result);\n  return result;\n}\nIn this example, we define a permute function that takes a string as an argument and returns an array of all permutations of the string. The function first initializes an empty array result to store the permutations, and then calls a helper function permuteHelper with the string, the starting index (0), the ending index (length-1), and the result array as arguments. The permuteHelper function recursively swaps each character with every other character in the string, and adds the resulting permutations to the result array. The swap function is a helper function that swaps two characters in a string.\nHere's an example usage of the permute function:\ntypescript\nconst str = 'abc';\nconst result = permute(str);\nconsole.log(result); // ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']\nIn this example, we create a new string str with the value 'abc', and then call the permute function with str as the argument and assign the result to a new variable result. Finally, we log the value of result to the console, which should be ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba'].\nUsing Array.prototype.reduce(): Another approach is to use the reduce() method of the Array object to generate all permutations of the string. Here's an example implementation:\ntypescript\nfunction permute(str: string): string[] {\n  if (str.length === 1) {\n    return [str];\n  } else {\n    return str.split('').reduce((acc: string[], char: string, i: number) => {\n      const remainingChars = str.slice(0, i) + str.slice(i + 1);\n      const partialPermutations = permute(remainingChars);\n      return acc.concat(partialPermutations.map((permutation) => char + permutation));\n    }, []);\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a permute function that takes a string as an argument and returns an array of all permutations of the string. The function first checks if the length of the string is 1, in which case it returns an array with the string as the only element. Otherwise, it splits the string into an array of characters, and uses the reduce() method to generate all permutations of the string. The reduce() method iterates over each character in the string, and for each character, it generates all partial permutations of the remaining characters using recursion, and then combines the partial permutations with the current character to generate the full permutations.\nHere's an example usage of the permute function:\ntypescript\nconst str = 'abc';\nconst result = permute(str);\nconsole.log(result); // ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']\nIn this example, we create a new string str with the value 'abc', and then call the permute function with str as the argument and assign the result to a new variable result. Finally, we log the value of result to the console, which should be ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba'].\n1\nstackoverflow\n2\nw3resource\n3\nlinkedin\n4\ngitconnected\n5\ngeeksforgeeks"

The class has a constructor that takes the number of vertices as an argument and initializes an adjacency list for the graph. The class also has methods for adding edges to the graph, checking if the graph is cyclic, and checking if the graph is a tree. The isCyclicUtil() method is a helper method that performs a depth-first search to check if the graph contains any cycles. The isCyclic() method calls isCyclicUtil() for each unvisited vertex in the graph, and returns true if a cycle is found. The isTree() method first checks if the graph is cyclic, and returns false if it is. The method then performs a breadth-first search to check if the graph is connected, and returns true if it is.\nHere's an example usage of the Graph class:\ntypescript\nconst graph = new Graph(5);\ngraph.addEdge(1, 0);\ngraph.addEdge(0, 2);\ngraph.addEdge(0, 3);\ngraph.addEdge(3, 4);\nconst isTree = graph.isTree();\nconsole.log(isTree); // true\nIn this example, we create a new Graph instance with 5 vertices, and add edges to the graph to form a tree. We then call the isTree() method of the graph object, and assign the result to a new variable isTree. Finally, we log the value of isTree to the console, which should be true.\n1\nbaeldung\n2\ntutorialspoint\n3\ntechiedelight\n4\ntutorialhorizon\n5\ntutorialhorizon"

The class has a constructor that takes the number of vertices as an argument and initializes an adjacency list for the graph. The class also has methods for adding edges to the graph and performing a topological sort on the graph. The topologicalSort() method first calculates the in-degree of each vertex in the graph, i.e., the number of incoming edges for each vertex. The method then initializes a queue with all vertices that have an in-degree of 0. The method then enters a loop that removes a vertex from the queue, adds it to the sorted list, and removes the edges between the vertex and its adjacent vertices. If an adjacent vertex has no more incoming edges, it is added to the queue. The loop continues until the queue is empty. If the sorted list contains all vertices in the graph, the method returns the sorted list. Otherwise, the graph contains a cycle and a topological sort is not possible, so the method returns null.\nHere's an example usage of the Graph class:\ntypescript\nconst graph = new Graph(6);\ngraph.addEdge(5, 2);\ngraph.addEdge(5, 0);\ngraph.addEdge(4, 0);\ngraph.addEdge(4, 1);\ngraph.addEdge(2, 3);\ngraph.addEdge(3, 1);\nconst sorted = graph.topologicalSort();\nconsole.log(sorted); // [4, 5, 2, 0, 3, 1]\nIn this example, we create a new Graph instance with 6 vertices, and add edges to the graph to form a directed acyclic graph.

Here are a few examples:\nUsing an array: We can use an array to implement a circular buffer data structure. We can initialize an array of a fixed size, and use two pointers to keep track of the start and end of the buffer. We can then use modular arithmetic to wrap around the end pointer when it reaches the end of the array. Here's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from\n1\n:\ntypescript\nclass CircularBuffer<T> {\n  private buffer: T[];\n  private start: number;\n  private end: number;\n  constructor(size: number) {\n    this.buffer = new Array<T>(size);\n    this.start = 0;\n    this.end = 0;\n  }\n  private incrementPointer(pointer: number): number {\n    return (pointer + 1) % this.buffer.length;\n  }\n  private isFull(): boolean {\n    return this.incrementPointer(this.end) === this.start;\n  }\n  private isEmpty(): boolean {\n    return this.start === this.end;\n  }\n  write(value: T) {\n    if (this.isFull()) {\n      throw new Error('Buffer is full');\n    }\n    this.buffer[this.end] = value;\n    this.end = this.incrementPointer(this.end);\n  }\n  read(): T {\n    if (this.isEmpty()) {\n      throw new Error('Buffer is empty');\n    }\n    const value = this.buffer[this.start];\n    this.start = this.incrementPointer(this.start);\n    return value;\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a CircularBuffer class that represents a circular buffer data structure, with methods for writing and reading values from the buffer. The write method inserts a value into the buffer, and the read method removes and returns a value from the buffer. The class uses an array buffer of a fixed size, and two pointers start and end to keep track of the start and end of the buffer. The class uses modular arithmetic to wrap around the end pointer when it reaches the end of the array.\nHere's an example usage of the CircularBuffer class:\ntypescript\nconst buffer = new CircularBuffer<number>(3);\nbuffer.write(1);\nbuffer.write(2);\nbuffer.write(3);\nconsole.log(buffer.read()); // 1\nconsole.log(buffer.read()); // 2\nbuffer.write(4);\nconsole.log(buffer.read()); // 3\nconsole.log(buffer.read()); // 4\nIn this example, we create a new CircularBuffer instance with a size of 3, and write four values to the buffer using the write method.

There are several libraries available on npm that provide circular buffer implementations, such as ring-buffer-ts and circular-buffer.

Here's an example implementation of this approach, adapted from\n1\n:\ntypescript\nclass SkipListNode<T> {\n  value: T;\n  next: SkipListNode<T>[] | null;\n  constructor(value: T, level: number) {\n    this.value = value;\n    this.next = new Array<SkipListNode<T>>(level).fill(null);\n  }\n}\n\nclass SkipList<T> {\n  private head: SkipListNode<T>;\n  private maxLevel: number;\n  private levelProb: number;\n  constructor() {\n    this.head = new SkipListNode<T>(null, 1);\n    this.maxLevel = 1;\n    this.levelProb = 0.5;\n  }\n  private randomLevel(): number {\n    let level = 1;\n    while (Math.random() < this.levelProb && level < this.maxLevel + 1) {\n      level++;\n    }\n    return level;\n  }\n  add(value: T) {\n    const level = this.randomLevel();\n    const newNode = new SkipListNode<T>(value, level);\n    let current = this.head;\n    const update: SkipListNode<T>[] = new Array<SkipListNode<T>>(this.maxLevel).fill(null);\n    for (let i = this.maxLevel - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n      while (current.next && current.next[i].value < value) {\n        current = current.next[i];\n      }\n      update[i] = current;\n    }\n    for (let i = 0; i < level; i++) {\n      newNode.next![i] = update[i].next![i];\n      update[i].next![i] = newNode;\n    }\n    if (level > this.maxLevel) {\n      this.maxLevel = level;\n    }\n  }\n  find(value: T): SkipListNode<T> | null {\n    let current = this.head;\n    for (let i = this.maxLevel - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n      while (current.next && current.next[i].value < value) {\n        current = current.next[i];\n      }\n    }\n    if (current.next && current.next[0].value === value) {\n      return current.next[0];\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a SkipListNode class that represents a node in the skip list, with a value property for the node value, and a next property for an array of references to the next nodes. We define a SkipList class that represents a skip list data structure, with methods for adding and finding nodes in the skip list. The add method adds a node to the skip list, and the find method finds a node with a given value in the skip list.\nHere's an example usage of the SkipList class:\ntypescript\nconst skipList = new SkipList<number>();\nskipList.add(1);\nskipList.add(3);\nskipList.add(5);\nskipList.add(7);\nskipList.add(9);\nconst node = skipList.find(5);\nconsole.log(node?.value); // 5\nIn this example, we create a new SkipList instance, and add five values to the skip list using the add method. We then find the node with the value 5 using the find method, and assign the result to a new variable node. Finally, we log the value of node?.value to the console, which should be 5.\n1\ngeeksforgeeks"

The function checks if the input node is null, and returns true if true. Otherwise, the function initializes a stack with a tuple containing the input node, and the heights of its left and right subtrees.

Here's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from\n1\n:\ntypescript\nfunction maxSubArray(nums: number[]): number {\n  let currentSum = nums[0];\n  let maxSum = nums[0];\n  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\n    currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);\n    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);\n  }\n  return maxSum;\n}\nIn this example, we define a maxSubArray function that takes an array of integers as an argument, and returns the maximum subarray sum. The function initializes the currentSum and maxSum variables to the first element of the input array. The function then iterates over the remaining elements of the input array, and sets the currentSum variable to be whichever is larger: the current element plus the currentSum variable, or the current element. The function also sets the maxSum variable to be whichever is larger: the currentSum variable or the maxSum variable. The function then returns the maxSum variable.\nHere's an example usage of the maxSubArray function:\ntypescript\nconst nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4];\nconst result = maxSubArray(nums);\nconsole.log(result); // 6\nIn this example, we create an array of integers nums, and call the maxSubArray function with nums as the argument. We assign the result to a new variable result, and log the value of result to the console, which should be 6.\nUsing Kadane's algorithm: We can also use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in an array of integers. Kadane's algorithm is similar to the greedy algorithm, but it uses a slightly different approach to update the currentSum variable. Here's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from\n2\n:\ntypescript\nfunction maxSubArray(nums: number[]): number {\n  let maxSoFar = nums[0];\n  let maxEndingHere = nums[0];\n  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\n    maxEndingHere = Math.max(nums[i], maxEndingHere + nums[i]);\n    maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);\n  }\n  return maxSoFar;\n}\nIn this example, we define a maxSubArray function that takes an array of integers as an argument, and returns the maximum subarray sum. The function initializes the maxSoFar and maxEndingHere variables to the first element of the input array. The function then iterates over the remaining elements of the input array, and sets the maxEndingHere variable to be whichever is larger: the current element or the current element plus the maxEndingHere variable. The function also sets the maxSoFar variable to be whichever is larger: the maxSoFar variable or the maxEndingHere variable. The function then returns the maxSoFar variable.\nHere's an example usage of the maxSubArray function:\ntypescript\nconst nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4];\nconst result = maxSubArray(nums);\nconsole.log(result); // 6\nIn this example, we create an array of integers nums, and call the maxSubArray function with nums as the argument.

Here are a few examples:\nUsing Depth-First Search (DFS): We can perform a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph using Depth-First Search (DFS). We can start by visiting a vertex and recursively visiting all its neighbors. We can keep track of the visited vertices using a set or an array, and add the vertices to a stack in the order they are visited. Once we have visited all vertices, we can pop the vertices from the stack to get the topological order. Here's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from\n1\n:\ntypescript\nclass Graph {\n  private adjacencyList: Map<string, string[]>;\n  constructor() {\n    this.adjacencyList = new Map();\n  }\n  addVertex(vertex: string): void {\n    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {\n      this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);\n    }\n  }\n  addEdge(from: string, to: string): void {\n    this.addVertex(from);\n    this.addVertex(to);\n    this.adjacencyList.get(from)!.push(to);\n  }\n  topologicalSort(): string[] {\n    const visited: Set<string> = new Set();\n    const stack: string[] = [];\n    const dfs = (vertex: string) => {\n      visited.add(vertex);\n      for (const neighbor of this.adjacencyList.get(vertex)!) {\n        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {\n          dfs(neighbor);\n        }\n      }\n      stack.push(vertex);\n    };\n    for (const vertex of this.adjacencyList.keys()) {\n      if (!visited.has(vertex)) {\n        dfs(vertex);\n      }\n    }\n    return stack.reverse();\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a Graph class that represents a directed acyclic graph, with methods for adding vertices and edges to the graph, and for performing a topological sort on the graph. The class uses a map to store the adjacency list of the graph. The addVertex method adds a new vertex to the graph if it does not exist already. The addEdge method adds a new edge to the graph by adding the to vertex to the adjacency list of the from vertex. The topologicalSort method performs a topological sort on the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS). The method initializes a set of visited vertices, a stack of vertices in the order they are visited, and a recursive DFS function. The DFS function visits a vertex and recursively visits all its neighbors, adding the vertices to the stack in the order they are visited. The method then iterates over all vertices in the graph, and performs DFS on each vertex that has not been visited yet. The method returns the stack of vertices in the reverse order, which is the topological order of the graph.\nHere's an example usage of the Graph class:\ntypescript\nconst graph = new Graph();\ngraph.addEdge(\"A\", \"B\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"A\", \"C\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"B\", \"D\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"C\", \"D\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"C\", \"E\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"D\", \"E\");\nconsole.log(graph.topologicalSort()); // [\"A\", \"C\", \"E\", \"D\", \"B\"]\nIn this example, we create a new Graph instance and add 6 edges to the graph using the addEdge method. We then perform a topological sort on the graph using the topologicalSort method, and log the result to the console, which should be [\"A\", \"C\", \"E\", \"D\", \"B\"].\nUsing Kahn's algorithm: We can also perform a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph using Kahn's algorithm. The algorithm works by first finding all vertices with no incoming edges, and adding them to a queue. We then remove the vertices from the queue and their outgoing edges from the graph, and repeat the process until all vertices have been removed. Here's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from\n2\n:\ntypescript\nclass Graph {\n  private adjacencyList: Map<string, string[]>;\n  constructor() {\n    this.adjacencyList = new Map();\n  }\n  addVertex(vertex: string): void {\n    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {\n      this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);\n    }\n  }\n  addEdge(from: string, to: string): void {\n    this.addVertex(from);\n    this.addVertex(to);\n    this.adjacencyList.get(from)!.push(to);\n  }\n  topologicalSort(): string[] {\n    const inDegree: Map<string, number> = new Map();\n    for (const vertex of this.adjacencyList.keys()) {\n      inDegree.set(vertex, 0);\n    }\n    for (const neighbors of this.adjacencyList.values()) {\n      for (const neighbor of neighbors) {\n        inDegree.set(neighbor, inDegree.get(neighbor)! + 1);\n      }\n    }\n    const queue: string[] = [];\n    for (const [vertex, degree] of inDegree.entries()) {\n      if (degree === 0) {\n        queue.push(vertex);\n      }\n    }\n    const result: string[] = [];\n    while (queue.length > 0) {\n      const vertex = queue.shift()!;\n      result.push(vertex);\n      for (const neighbor of this.adjacencyList.get(vertex)!) {\n        inDegree.set(neighbor, inDegree.get(neighbor)! - 1);\n        if (inDegree.get(neighbor) === 0) {\n          queue.push(neighbor);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    return result.length === this.adjacencyList.size ? result : [];\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a Graph class that represents a directed acyclic graph, with methods for adding vertices and edges to the graph, and for performing a topological sort on the graph. The class uses a map to store the adjacency list of the graph. The addVertex method adds a new vertex to the graph if it does not exist already. The addEdge method adds a new edge to the graph by adding the to vertex to the adjacency list of the from vertex. The topologicalSort method performs a topological sort on the graph using Kahn's algorithm. The method initializes a map of incoming degrees for each vertex in the graph, and a queue of vertices with no incoming edges. The method then iterates over all edges in the graph, and updates the incoming degrees of each vertex. The method then adds all vertices with no incoming edges to the queue. The method then iteratively removes vertices from the queue, adds them to the result, and removes their outgoing edges from the graph, until all vertices have been removed or there is a cycle in the graph. The method returns the result, which is the topological order of the graph, or an empty array if there is a cycle in the graph.\nHere's an example usage of the Graph class:\ntypescript\nconst graph = new Graph();\ngraph.addEdge(\"A\", \"B\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"A\", \"C\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"B\", \"D\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"C\", \"\n1\nricardoborges\n2\nnpmjs"

        "Output": "To implement a k-d tree data structure in TypeScript, we can use one of the existing libraries or implement our own. Here are a few options:\nUsing an existing library: There are several existing libraries for k-d trees in JavaScript and TypeScript, such as kd-tree-javascript\n1\nand node-kdtree\n2\n. These libraries provide a simple and efficient implementation of the k-d tree data structure, with methods for inserting and querying points in the tree. To use these libraries, we can install them using a package manager like npm and import them in our TypeScript code.\nImplementing our own: We can also implement our own k-d tree data structure in TypeScript. A k-d tree is a binary tree that partitions points in a k-dimensional space by recursively splitting the space along the median of one of the dimensions. Each node in the tree represents a hyperrectangle in the space, and stores a point and the median value of one of the dimensions. The left child of a node represents the hyperrectangle to the left of the median, and the right child represents the hyperrectangle to the right of the median. To insert a point in the tree, we start at the root and recursively traverse the tree, splitting the hyperrectangles along the median of the dimensions until we reach a leaf node, where we insert the point. To query the tree for the nearest neighbor of a point, we start at the root and recursively traverse the tree, keeping track of the best candidate for the nearest neighbor found so far, and pruning the search when the distance to the hyperrectangle of a node is greater than the distance to the best candidate.\nHere's an example implementation of a k-d tree data structure in TypeScript, adapted from\n3\n:\ntypescript\nclass KDTree {\n  private root: KDNode | null;\n  constructor(private k: number) {\n    this.root = null;\n  }\n  insert(point: number[]): void {\n    const node = new KDNode(point);\n    if (this.root === null) {\n      this.root = node;\n    } else {\n      let current = this.root;\n      let depth = 0;\n      while (true) {\n        const dimension = depth % this.k;\n        if (point[dimension] < current.point[dimension]) {\n          if (current.left === null) {\n            current.left = node;\n            break;\n          } else {\n            current = current.left;\n          }\n        } else {\n          if (current.right === null) {\n            current.right = node;\n            break;\n          } else {\n            current = current.right;\n          }\n        }\n        depth++;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  nearestNeighbor(point: number[]): number[] | null {\n    let best: number[] | null = null;\n    let bestDistance = Infinity;\n    const search = (node: KDNode | null, depth: number) => {\n      if (node === null) {\n        return;\n      }\n      const distance = KDTree.distance(point, node.point);\n      if (distance < bestDistance) {\n        best = node.point;\n        bestDistance = distance;\n      }\n      const dimension = depth % this.k;\n      const diff = point[dimension] - node.point[dimension];\n      const left = diff < 0;\n      search(left ? node.left : node.right, depth + 1);\n      if (diff * diff < bestDistance) {\n        search(left ? node.right : node.left, depth + 1);\n      }\n    };\n    search(this.root, 0);\n    return best;\n  }\n  private static distance(a: number[], b: number[]): number {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n      sum += (a[i] - b[i]) ** 2;\n    }\n    return Math.sqrt(sum);\n  }\n}\n\nclass KDNode {\n  left: KDNode | null;\n  right: KDNode | null;\n  constructor(public point: number[]) {\n    this.left = null;\n    this.right = null;\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a KDTree class that represents a k-d tree data structure, with methods for inserting points in the tree and querying the nearest neighbor of a point. The class uses a KDNode class to represent nodes in the tree, with a point property that stores the coordinates of the point, and left and right properties that store the left and right child nodes. The KDTree class has a root property that stores the root node of the tree, and a k property that stores the number of dimensions of the space. The insert method inserts a new point in the tree by recursively traversing the tree and splitting the hyperrectangles along the median of the dimensions. The nearestNeighbor method queries the tree for the nearest neighbor of a point by recursively traversing the tree and keeping track of the best candidate for the nearest neighbor found so far, and pruning the search when the distance to the hyperrectangle of a node is greater than the distance to the best candidate. The distance method calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.\nHere's an example usage of the KDTree class:\ntypescript\nconst tree = new KDTree(2);\ntree.insert([2, 3]);\ntree.insert([5, 4]);\ntree.insert([9, 6]);\ntree.insert([4, 7]);\ntree.insert([8, 1]);\nconsole.log(tree.nearestNeighbor([3, 5])); // [2, 3]\nconsole.log(tree.nearestNeighbor([7, 2])); // [8, 1]\nIn this example, we create a new KDTree instance with 2 dimensions, and insert 5 points in the tree using the insert method. We then query the tree for the nearest neighbor of 2 points using the nearestNeighbor method, and log the result to the console.\nReferences:\n1\nhttps://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript\n4\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/23eovy/a_fast_static_kdtree_for_javascript/\n2\nhttps://justinethier.github.io/node-kdtree/\n3\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-dimensional-tree/\n1\ngithub\n2\njustinethier\n3\nscholarhat\n4\nreddit"

The lowestCommonAncestor function finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree using recursion. The function takes a root node and two nodes p and q as arguments. If the root node is null or equal to p or q, then it is the lowest common ancestor. Otherwise, we recursively traverse the left and right subtrees of the root node, and check if p and q are in different subtrees. If they are, then the root node is the lowest common ancestor. If they are in the same subtree, then we recursively traverse that subtree until we find the lowest common ancestor.\nHere's an example usage of the lowestCommonAncestor function:\ntypescript\nconst root = new TreeNode(3);\nroot.left = new TreeNode(5);\nroot.right = new TreeNode(1);\nroot.left.left = new TreeNode(6);\nroot.left.right = new TreeNode(2);\nroot.right.left = new TreeNode(0);\nroot.right.right = new TreeNode(8);\nroot.left.right.left = new TreeNode(7);\nroot.left.right.right = new TreeNode(4);\nconsole.log(lowestCommonAncestor(root, root.left, root.right)); // 3\nconsole.log(lowestCommonAncestor(root, root.left, root.left.right.right)); // 5\nIn this example, we create a new binary tree with 9 nodes, and find the lowest common ancestor of two pairs of nodes using the lowestCommonAncestor function, and log the result to the console.\nUsing parent pointers: If the binary tree has parent pointers, we can find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes by traversing up the tree from both nodes until we find a common ancestor. We can use a set or a map to keep track of the ancestors of one node, and traverse up the tree from the other node until we find a common ancestor.

To use this library, we can install it using a package manager like npm and import it in our TypeScript code.\nImplementing our own: We can also implement our own splay tree data structure in TypeScript. A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree data structure that reorganizes itself based on the accessed or inserted elements. In other words, the tree automatically reorganizes itself so that frequently accessed or inserted elements become closer to the root node. The splay tree maintains a property called the splay property, which ensures that the tree is balanced and that frequently accessed or inserted elements are moved closer to the root node. To insert a node in the tree, we first search for the node in the tree, and splay the node to the root. If the node is not found, we insert it at the root. To delete a node from the tree, we first search for the node in the tree, and splay its parent to the root. We then remove the node from the tree, and splay its grandparent to the root.

We also define a FlowNetwork class that represents a flow network, with methods for adding edges to the network and computing the maximum flow in the network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. The FlowNetwork class uses an adjacency list to represent the edges in the network, and a flow array to store the flow through each edge. The maxFlow method computes the maximum flow in the network between a source node and a sink node using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. The method initializes the flow to zero, and repeatedly finds an augmenting path from the source node to the sink node using a breadth-first search, and updates the flow along the path. The method terminates when no more augmenting paths can be found.\nHere's an example usage of the FlowNetwork class:\ntypescript\nconst network = new FlowNetwork(6);\nnetwork.addEdge(0, 1, 16);\nnetwork.addEdge(0, 2, 13);\nnetwork.addEdge(1, 2, 10);\nnetwork.addEdge(1, 3, 12);\nnetwork.addEdge(2, 1, 4);\nnetwork.addEdge(2, 4, 14);\nnetwork.addEdge(3, 2, 9);\nnetwork.addEdge(3, 5, 20);\nnetwork.addEdge(4, 3, 7);\nnetwork.addEdge(4, 5, 4);\nconsole.log(network.maxFlow(0, 5)); // 23\nIn this example, we create a new FlowNetwork instance with 6 nodes and 10 edges, and add edges to the network using the addEdge method. We then compute the maximum flow in the network between the 0 node and the 5 node using the maxFlow method, and log the result to the console.\nReferences:\n1\nhttps://github.com/prabod/Graph-Theory-Ford-Fulkerson-Maximum-Flow\n1\ngithub"

        "Input": "Implement a persistent data structure in TypeScript.",
        "Output": "To implement a persistent data structure in TypeScript, we can use an existing library or implement our own. Here are a few options:\nUsing an existing library: There is an existing TypeScript library for persistent data structures available on GitHub\n1\n. This library provides a collection of persistent data structures, including lists, maps, and sets, that are entirely immutable and efficiently share elements between each other. For example, prepending to a persistent list only creates a new node that references the old list. To use this library, we can install it using a package manager like npm and import it in our TypeScript code.\nImplementing our own: We can also implement our own persistent data structure in TypeScript. A persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified, so that previous versions can still be accessed and used. One way to implement a persistent data structure is to use copy-on-write semantics, where any updates to the data structure create a new copy of the data structure that shares as much data as possible with the previous version. For example, if we have a persistent list and we want to append an element to it, we can create a new list that references the old list and the new element. Here's an example implementation of a persistent list in TypeScript, adapted from\n2\n:\ntypescript\nclass PersistentList<T> {\n  constructor(private head: T | null, private tail: PersistentList<T> | null) {}\n  prepend(value: T): PersistentList<T> {\n    return new PersistentList(value, this);\n  }\n  get(index: number): T | null {\n    if (index === 0) {\n      return this.head;\n    } else if (this.tail === null) {\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return this.tail.get(index - 1);\n    }\n  }\n  set(index: number, value: T): PersistentList<T> {\n    if (index === 0) {\n      return new PersistentList(value, this.tail);\n    } else if (this.tail === null) {\n      return this;\n    } else {\n      return new PersistentList(this.head, this.tail.set(index - 1, value));\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a PersistentList class that represents a persistent list data structure, with a head property that stores the value of the first element, and a tail property that stores a reference to the rest of the list. The prepend method creates a new list that prepends a new element to the current list. The get method returns the value at a given index in the list, or null if the index is out of bounds. The set method creates a new list that sets the value at a given index in the list to a new value.\nHere's an example usage of the PersistentList class:\ntypescript\nconst list1 = new PersistentList(1, new PersistentList(2, new PersistentList(3, null)));\nconst list2 = list1.prepend(0);\nconsole.log(list1.get(2)); // 3\nconsole.log(list2.get(2)); // 3\nconst list3 = list2.set(1, -1);\nconsole.log(list2.get(1)); // 2\nconsole.log(list3.get(1)); // -1\nIn this example, we create a new PersistentList instance with 3 elements, and prepend a new element to the list using the prepend method. We then get the value at a given index in the original list and the new list using the get method, and log the results to the console. We also set the value at a given index in the new list using the set method, and log the result to the console.\nReferences:\n1\nhttps://github.com/cronokirby/persistent-ts\n3\nhttps://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/persistent-ts\n2\nhttps://dev.to/japiirainen/immutable-data-structures-in-typescript-530i\n1\ngithub\n2\ndev\n3\nsnyk"

Here's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from\n1\n:\ntypescript\nfunction shortestCommonSupersequence(str1: string, str2: string): string {\n  const m = str1.length;\n  const n = str2.length;\n  const dp: number[][] = new Array(m + 1).fill(null).map(() => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));\n  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n      if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {\n        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;\n      } else {\n        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  let i = m;\n  let j = n;\n  const supersequence: string[] = [];\n  while (i > 0 && j > 0) {\n    if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {\n      supersequence.unshift(str1[i - 1]);\n      i--;\n      j--;\n    } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {\n      supersequence.unshift(str1[i - 1]);\n      i--;\n    } else {\n      supersequence.unshift(str2[j - 1]);\n      j--;\n    }\n  }\n  while (i > 0) {\n    supersequence.unshift(str1[i - 1]);\n    i--;\n  }\n  while (j > 0) {\n    supersequence.unshift(str2[j - 1]);\n    j--;\n  }\n  return supersequence.join('');\n}\nIn this example, we define a shortestCommonSupersequence function that takes two strings str1 and str2 as arguments, and returns the shortest common supersequence of the two strings. The function uses dynamic programming to find the length of the shortest common supersequence, and backtracking to construct the supersequence. The dp array stores the length of the longest common subsequence of the prefixes of str1 and str2. The function initializes the dp array to zero, and iterates over the characters of str1 and str2, updating the dp array based on whether the characters match or not. The function then constructs the supersequence by backtracking from the bottom-right corner of the dp array, adding characters to the supersequence based on whether they were part of the longest common subsequence or not.\nHere's an example usage of the shortestCommonSupersequence function:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(shortestCommonSupersequence('geek', 'eke')); // geeke\nconsole.log(shortestCommonSupersequence('AGGTAB', 'GXTXAYB')); // AGGXTXAYB\nIn this example, we find the shortest common supersequence of two pairs of strings using the shortestCommonSupersequence function, and log the results to the console.\nReferences:\n1\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-common-supersequence/\n1\ngeeksforgeeks"

The implementation then iterates over the sorted edges, and for each edge, checks if its endpoints belong to different connected components. If they do, the implementation adds the edge to the minimum spanning tree and merges the connected components.\nThe GeeksforGeeks website provides a detailed explanation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The article explains how to use a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of the connected components of the graph, and sorts the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights. The article then provides a step-by-step explanation of how to iterate over the sorted edges, and for each edge, check if its endpoints belong to different connected components. If they do, the article adds the edge to the minimum spanning tree and merges the connected components.\nHere's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript, adapted from the typescript-algorithms repository on GitHub:\ntypescript\ninterface Edge {\n  source: number;\n  destination: number;\n  weight: number;\n}\n\nclass DisjointSet {\n  parent: number[];\n\n  constructor(size: number) {\n    this.parent = new Array(size).fill(-1);\n  }\n\n  find(x: number): number {\n    if (this.parent[x] === -1) {\n      return x;\n    }\n    this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);\n    return this.parent[x];\n  }\n\n  union(x: number, y: number): void {\n    const rootX = this.find(x);\n    const rootY = this.find(y);\n    if (rootX !== rootY) {\n      this.parent[rootX] = rootY;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction kruskal(edges: Edge[], numVertices: number): Edge[] {\n  const sortedEdges = edges.slice().sort((a, b) => a.weight - b.weight);\n  const disjointSet = new DisjointSet(numVertices);\n  const minimumSpanningTree: Edge[] = [];\n  for (const edge of sortedEdges) {\n    if (disjointSet.find(edge.source) !== disjointSet.find(edge.destination)) {\n      disjointSet.union(edge.source, edge.destination);\n      minimumSpanningTree.push(edge);\n    }\n    if (minimumSpanningTree.length === numVertices - 1) {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  return minimumSpanningTree;\n}\nIn this example, we define an Edge interface that represents an edge in the graph, with source, destination, and weight properties. We also define a DisjointSet class that represents the disjoint-set data structure used to keep track of the connected components of the graph. The kruskal function takes an array of Edge objects and the number of vertices in the graph as arguments, and returns an array of Edge objects representing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. The function first sorts the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights, and then iterates over the sorted edges, checking if their endpoints belong to different connected components. If they do, the function adds the edge to the minimum spanning tree and merges the connected components. The function continues iterating over the edges until all vertices are in the same connected component.\nHere's an example usage of the kruskal function:\ntypescript\nconst edges: Edge[] = [\n  { source: 0, destination: 1, weight: 4 },\n  { source: 0, destination: 7, weight: 8 },\n  { source: 1, destination: 2, weight: 8 },\n  { source: 1, destination: 7, weight: 11 },\n  { source: 2, destination: 3, weight: 7 },\n  { source: 2, destination: 8, weight: 2 },\n  { source: 2, destination: 5, weight: 4 },\n  { source: 3, destination: 4, weight: 9 },\n  { source: 3, destination: 5, weight: 14 },\n  { source: 4, destination: 5, weight: 10 },\n  { source: 5, destination: 6, weight: 2 },\n  { source: 6, destination: 7, weight: 1 },\n  { source: 6, destination: 8, weight: 6 },\n  { source: 7, destination: 8, weight: 7 },\n];\nconst numVertices = 9;\nconst minimumSpanningTree = kruskal(edges, numVertices);\nconsole.log(minimumSpanningTree); // [{ source: 6, destination: 7, weight: 1 }, { source: 2, destination: 8, weight: 2 }, { source: 5, destination: 6, weight: 2 }, { source: 0, destination: 1, weight: 4 }, { source: 2, destination: 5, weight: 4 }, { source: 2, destination: 3, weight: 7 }, { source: 0, destination: 7, weight: 8 }, { source: 3, destination: 4, weight: 9 }]\nIn this example, we create an array of Edge objects representing a graph, and find the minimum spanning tree of the graph using the kruskal function, logging the\n1\ngithub\n2\nnpmjs\n3\nmedium\n4\npacktpub\n5\ngeeksforgeeks"

The implementation includes a RopeSequence class that represents the Rope data structure, with methods for inserting, deleting, and slicing strings.\nHere's an example implementation of a Rope data structure in TypeScript, adapted from the component/rope repository on GitHub:\ntypescript\nclass Rope {\n  left: Rope | string;\n  right: Rope | string;\n  length: number;\n\n  constructor(left: Rope | string, right: Rope | string) {\n    this.left = left;\n    this.right = right;\n    this.length = (left instanceof Rope ? left.length : left.length) + (right instanceof Rope ? right.length : right.length);\n  }\n\n  static create(str: string): Rope {\n    return new Rope(str.slice(0, str.length / 2), str.slice(str.length / 2));\n  }\n\n  charAt(index: number): string {\n    if (index < 0 || index >= this.length) {\n      throw new Error(\"Index out of range\");\n    }\n    if (this.left instanceof Rope) {\n      if (index < this.left.length) {\n        return this.left.charAt(index);\n      }\n      return this.right.charAt(index - this.left.length);\n    }\n    return this.left[index];\n  }\n\n  substring(start: number, end: number): string {\n    if (start < 0 || end > this.length || start > end) {\n      throw new Error(\"Index out of range\");\n    }\n    if (start === 0 && end === this.length) {\n      return this.toString();\n    }\n    if (this.left instanceof Rope) {\n      if (end <= this.left.length) {\n        return this.left.substring(start, end);\n      }\n      if (start >= this.left.length) {\n        return this.right.substring(start - this.left.length, end - this.left.length);\n      }\n      return this.left.substring(start, this.left.length) + this.right.substring(0, end - this.left.length);\n    }\n    return this.left.substring(start, end);\n  }\n\n  toString(): string {\n    if (this.left instanceof Rope) {\n      return this.left.toString() + this.right.toString();\n    }\n    return this.left + this.right;\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a Rope class that represents the Rope data structure, with left, right, and length properties. The implementation includes a create method that creates a new Rope from a string, and charAt, substring, and toString methods that allow access to the Rope's contents. The charAt method returns the character at a given index in the Rope, the substring method returns a substring of the Rope, and the toString method returns the Rope as a string.\nHere's an example usage of the Rope class:\ntypescript\nconst rope = Rope.create(\"Hello World\");\nconsole.log(rope.substring(0, 5)); // \"Hello\"\nconsole.log(rope.substring(6, 11)); // \"World\"\nconsole.log(rope.charAt(1)); // \"e\"\nconsole.log(rope.toString()); // \"Hello World\"\nIn this example, we create a new Rope from a string and use the substring, charAt, and toString methods to access its contents, logging the results to the console.\n1\ngithub\n2\ngithub\n3\nmedium\n4\ndev\n5\nnpmjs"

Johnson's algorithm is very similar to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm; however, Floyd-Warshall is most effective for dense graphs (many edges), while Johnson's algorithm is most effective for sparse graphs (few edges). Johnson's algorithm is interesting because it uses two other shortest path algorithms as subroutines. It uses Bellman-Ford in order to reweight the input graph to eliminate negative edges and detect negative cycles. With this new, altered graph, it then uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to calculate the shortest path between all pairs of vertices.

However, I can provide an overview of what a skip quadlist is and how it works.\nA skip quadlist is a data structure that is similar to a skip list, but instead of using linked lists, it uses quadtrees to store and retrieve data. A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children, corresponding to the four quadrants of the coordinate system. Each leaf node represents a small square region of the plane, and the root node represents the entire plane. A skip quadlist is a collection of quadtree nodes that are linked together to form a list.\nThe skip quadlist is used to store and retrieve data that is associated with points in a two-dimensional space. Each point is stored in a leaf node of the quadtree, and the quadtree is used to efficiently search for points that are close to a given point. The skip quadlist is used to speed up this search by skipping over large regions of the quadtree that are unlikely to contain any points that are close to the given point.\nTo implement a skip quadlist in TypeScript, you would need to define classes for the quadtree nodes and the skip quadlist nodes, and implement methods for inserting, deleting, and searching for points in the quadtree.

In other words, we need to find the length of the longest subarray that first increases and then decreases.\nHere are some resources that provide examples of how to solve this problem:\nThe Techie Delight website provides a detailed explanation of the longest bitonic subarray problem and its implementation in TypeScript.\nThe GeeksforGeeks website provides a solution to the \"Maximum Length Bitonic Subarray\" problem, which can be adapted to TypeScript.\nThe LeetCode website provides a discussion on how to find the largest bitonic subarray in an array, which can be adapted to TypeScript.\nHere's an example implementation of this approach in TypeScript:\ntypescript\nfunction longestBitonicSubarray(arr: number[]): number {\n  const n = arr.length;\n  const inc = new Array(n).fill(1);\n  const dec = new Array(n).fill(1);\n\n  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) {\n      inc[i] = inc[i - 1] + 1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {\n    if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {\n      dec[i] = dec[i + 1] + 1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  let max = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (inc[i] + dec[i] - 1 > max) {\n      max = inc[i] + dec[i] - 1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return max;\n}\nIn this example, we define a longestBitonicSubarray function that takes an array of integers arr as an argument and returns the length of the longest bitonic subarray in the array. The function first initializes two arrays inc and dec with the value 1 for each element. It then iterates over the elements of the input array, updating the inc array with the length of the longest increasing subarray ending at each element. It then iterates over the elements of the input array in reverse order, updating the dec array with the length of the longest decreasing subarray starting from each element. Finally, the function iterates over the elements of the input array, calculating the length of the longest bitonic subarray that includes each element, and returns the maximum length.\nHere's an example usage of the longestBitonicSubarray function:\ntypescript\nconst arr = [4, 5, 9, 5, 6, 10, 11, 9, 6, 4, 5];\nconst longestSubarray = longestBitonicSubarray(arr);\nconsole.log(longestSubarray); // 7\nIn this example, we create an array of integers and find the length of the longest bitonic subarray in the array using the longestBitonicSubarray function, logging the result to the console.\n1\ntechiedelight\n2\ntutorialspoint\n3\nw3resource\n4\ngeeksforgeeks\n5\ngeeksforgeeks"

        "Output": "There are several ways to remove duplicates from an array and return a new array with unique values in JavaScript. Here are some of the most common methods:\nUsing a Set: A Set is a collection of unique values. To remove duplicates from an array using a Set, first convert the array to a Set, then convert the Set back to an array. Here's an example:\njavascript\nfunction removeDuplicates(arr) {\n  return [...new Set(arr)];\n}\nIn this example, we define a removeDuplicates function that takes an array arr as an argument and returns a new array with unique values. The function first converts the array to a Set using the spread operator ... and the new Set() constructor. The Set implicitly removes duplicate elements. The function then converts the Set back to an array using the spread operator.\nUsing the filter() method: The filter() method creates a new array of elements that pass the condition we provide. We can remove duplicate values from the array by simply adjusting our condition. Here's an example:\njavascript\nfunction removeDuplicates(arr) {\n  return arr.filter((value, index) => arr.indexOf(value) === index);\n}\nIn this example, we define a removeDuplicates function that takes an array arr as an argument and returns a new array with unique values. The function uses the filter() method to create a new array of elements that pass the condition we provide. The condition checks if the index of the current element is equal to the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array. If the condition is true, the element is included in the new array.\nUsing the reduce() method: The reduce() method applies a function to each element of an array and reduces the array to a single value. We can use the reduce() method to create a new array with unique values. Here's an example:\njavascript\nfunction removeDuplicates(arr) {\n  return arr.reduce((unique, item) => {\n    return unique.includes(item) ? unique : [...unique, item];\n  }, []);\n}\nIn this example, we define a removeDuplicates function that takes an array arr as an argument and returns a new array with unique values. The function uses the reduce() method to apply a function to each element of the array and reduce the array to a single value. The function checks if the current element is already included in the new array. If the element is not included, the function returns a new array with the element added. If the element is already included, the function returns the original array.\nHere's an example usage of the removeDuplicates function:\njavascript\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5];\nconsole.log(removeDuplicates(arr)); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nIn this example, we create an array with duplicate values and remove the duplicates using the removeDuplicates function, logging the result to the console.\nNote that there are other ways to remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript, such as using the indexOf() and push() methods or using the forEach() method.

A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a set of strings and allows for efficient prefix search and autocomplete functionality\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n.

The TrieNode class represents a node in the trie and has a children property that maps each character to its child node and an isEndOfWord property that indicates whether the node represents the end of a word. The Trie class represents the trie data structure and has a root property that represents the root node of the trie. It also has two methods: insert() and searchPrefix(). The insert() method takes a string word as input and inserts it into the trie by iterating over each character in the string and creating a new node for each character that does not already exist. It sets the isEndOfWord property of the final node to true to indicate that the word has been fully inserted into the trie. The searchPrefix() method takes a string prefix as input and returns an array of all words in the trie that start with the given prefix. It does this by iterating over each character in the prefix and traversing the trie to find the node that represents the last character in the prefix. It then calls the _findAllWords() method to recursively find all words that start with the prefix by traversing the trie from the last node and adding each word to an array. The _findAllWords() method takes a node node and a string prefix as input and returns an array of all words in the trie that start with the given prefix by recursively traversing the trie and adding each word to an array\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n.\nFor example, the following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the Trie class to insert words and search for prefixes:\njavascript\nlet trie = new Trie();\ntrie.insert('hello');\ntrie.insert('world');\ntrie.insert('hey');\ntrie.insert('he');\nlet words = trie.searchPrefix('he');\nconsole.log(`Words that start with \"he\": ${words}`);\nThis program first initializes a new Trie object trie. It then inserts four words into the trie using the insert() method. Finally, it calls the searchPrefix() method with the prefix 'he' to find all words in the trie that start with the prefix and stores the result in a variable words.

Here's an example implementation of the function:\njavascript\nfunction isBalanced(expression) {\n  let stack = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < expression.length; i++) {\n    if (expression[i] === '(' || expression[i] === '{' || expression[i] === '[') {\n      stack.push(expression[i]);\n    } else if (expression[i] === ')' && stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === '(') {\n      stack.pop();\n    } else if (expression[i] === '}' && stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === '{') {\n      stack.pop();\n    } else if (expression[i] === ']' && stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === '[') {\n      stack.pop();\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return stack.length === 0;\n}\nThe above function takes a string expression representing an arithmetic expression as input and returns true if the expression has balanced parentheses and false otherwise. It first initializes an empty array stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. It then uses a loop to iterate over the string from left to right and pushes opening parentheses onto the stack and pops closing parentheses from the stack if they match the top element of the stack. If a closing parenthesis does not match the top element of the stack or there are no elements in the stack, the function returns false. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, the function returns true\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n.\nFor example, the following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the isBalanced() function to check if a given string is an arithmetic expression with balanced parentheses:\njavascript\nlet expression = '2 * (3 + 5) - 4 / (2 + 1)';\nlet balanced = isBalanced(expression);\nconsole.log(`The expression \"${expression}\" is ${balanced ? 'balanced' : 'unbalanced'}`);\nThis program first initializes a string expression representing an arithmetic expression. It then calls the isBalanced() function to check if the expression has balanced parentheses and stores the result in a variable balanced. Finally, it prints a message indicating whether the expression has balanced parentheses or not.\nNote that there are other algorithms and libraries to check if a given string is an arithmetic expression with balanced parentheses in JavaScript, such as using regular expressions or the jsep library\n1\n6\n.

We can then combine the two functions to achieve the desired result\n1\n2\n3\n.\nHere's an example implementation of the two functions:\njavascript\nfunction reverseWords(sentence) {\n  let words = sentence.split(' ');\n  let reversedWords = [];\n  for (let i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    reversedWords.push(words[i]);\n  }\n  return reversedWords.join(' ');\n}\n\nfunction alternateCase(sentence) {\n  let result = '';\n  for (let i = 0; i < sentence.length; i++) {\n    if (i % 2 === 0) {\n      result += sentence[i].toUpperCase();\n    } else {\n      result += sentence[i].toLowerCase();\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\nfunction reverseAndAlternate(sentence) {\n  let reversed = reverseWords(sentence);\n  let alternated = alternateCase(reversed);\n  return alternated;\n}\nThe reverseWords() function takes a string sentence representing a sentence as input and returns a new string with the words in reverse order. It first splits the sentence into an array of words using the split() method. It then initializes an empty array reversedWords and uses a loop to iterate over the words in reverse order and push them onto the reversedWords array. Finally, it joins the reversedWords array into a new string using the join() method and returns the result.\nThe alternateCase() function takes a string sentence representing a sentence as input and returns a new string with each character alternating between uppercase and lowercase. It initializes an empty string result and uses a loop to iterate over each character in the sentence. If the index of the character is even, it converts the character to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method and appends it to the result string. Otherwise, it converts the character to lowercase using the toLowerCase() method and appends it to the result string. Finally, it returns the result string.\nThe reverseAndAlternate() function takes a string sentence representing a sentence as input and returns a new string with the words in reverse order and each character alternating between uppercase and lowercase. It first calls the reverseWords() function to reverse the order of words in the sentence and stores the result in a variable reversed. It then calls the alternateCase() function to alternate the case of each character in the reversed string and stores the result in a variable alternated. Finally, it returns the alternated string.\nFor example, the following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the reverseAndAlternate() function to reverse the order of words and alternate the case of each character in a given sentence:\njavascript\nlet sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';\nlet reversedAndAlternated = reverseAndAlternate(sentence);\nconsole.log(`The sentence \"${sentence}\" becomes \"${reversedAndAlternated}\"`);\nThis program first initializes a string sentence representing a sentence. It then calls the reverseAndAlternate() function to reverse the order of words and alternate the case of each character in the sentence and stores the result in a variable reversedAndAlternated.

        "Output": "JavaScript class for a hash table data structure with methods for inserting and retrieving key-value pairs\nA hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs. In JavaScript, we can implement a hash table using an array and a hash function that maps keys to indices in the array\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\nHere's an example implementation of a JavaScript class for a hash table data structure with methods for inserting and retrieving key-value pairs:\njavascript\nclass HashTable {\n  constructor(size = 50) {\n    this.buckets = new Array(size);\n    this.size = size;\n  }\n\n  hash(key) {\n    return key.toString().length % this.size;\n  }\n\n  set(key, value) {\n    let index = this.hash(key);\n    if (!this.buckets[index]) {\n      this.buckets[index] = [];\n    }\n    for (let i = 0; i < this.buckets[index].length; i++) {\n      if (this.buckets[index][i][0] === key) {\n        this.buckets[index][i][1] = value;\n        return;\n      }\n    }\n    this.buckets[index].push([key, value]);\n  }\n\n  get(key) {\n    let index = this.hash(key);\n    if (!this.buckets[index]) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    for (let i = 0; i < this.buckets[index].length; i++) {\n      if (this.buckets[index][i][0] === key) {\n        return this.buckets[index][i][1];\n      }\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n}\nThe HashTable class takes an optional size parameter that specifies the size of the hash table. It initializes an array buckets of size size and a size property to keep track of the size of the hash table. It also defines a hash() method that takes a key and returns an index in the buckets array.\nThe set() method takes a key and a value and inserts them into the hash table. It first computes the index of the key using the hash() method. If the bucket at the computed index is empty, it initializes it as an empty array. It then checks if the key already exists in the bucket and updates its value if it does. Otherwise, it appends the key-value pair to the bucket.\nThe get() method takes a key and returns its corresponding value in the hash table. It first computes the index of the key using the hash() method. If the bucket at the computed index is empty, it returns null. It then iterates over the key-value pairs in the bucket and returns the value of the first key that matches the input key. If no such key is found, it returns null.\nFor example, the following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the HashTable class to insert and retrieve key-value pairs:\njavascript\nlet table = new HashTable();\ntable.set('apple', 1);\ntable.set('banana', 2);\ntable.set('cherry', 3);\nconsole.log(table.get('apple')); // 1\nconsole.log(table.get('banana')); // 2\nconsole.log(table.get('cherry')); // 3\nconsole.log(table.get('durian')); // null\nThis program first creates a new HashTable object and inserts three key-value pairs into it using the set() method. It then retrieves the values of the keys 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', and 'durian' using the get() method and prints them to the console.\nNote that there are other algorithms and libraries to implement a hash table data structure in JavaScript, such as using separate chaining or open addressing to handle collisions\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.

It first initializes an array lengths of size n x n to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences of each pair of strings. It then uses a nested loop to compute the length of the longest common subsequence of each pair of strings using dynamic programming. If the two strings are the same, the length of the longest common subsequence is simply the length of the string. Otherwise, it uses a two-dimensional array lcs to compute the length of the longest common subsequence using the dynamic programming algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem. It then stores the computed length in the lengths array.\nAfter computing the lengths of the longest common subsequences, the function uses the lengths array to reconstruct the longest common subsequence. It initializes an empty string result and two indices i and j to n - 1. It then uses a loop to iterate over the lengths array and reconstruct the longest common subsequence. If the two indices are equal, it appends the substring of the string at index i with length equal to the length of the longest common subsequence to the result string and decrements both indices. Otherwise, it checks if the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings at indices i and j - 1 is greater than or equal to the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings at indices i - 1 and j. If it is, it decrements j. Otherwise, it decrements i. Finally, if the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings at indices i and j is greater than the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings at indices i - 1 and j - 1, it appends the substring of the string at index i with length equal to the length of the longest common subsequence minus the length of the longest common subsequence of the two strings at indices i - 1 and j - 1 to the result string and decrements both indices.\nFor example, the following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the longestCommonSubsequence() function to find the longest common subsequence among a set of strings:\njavascript\nlet strings = ['AGGTAB', 'GXTXAYB', 'GTAB'];\nlet lcs = longestCommonSubsequence(strings);\nconsole.log(`The longest common subsequence among ${strings} is ${lcs}`);\nThis program first initializes an array strings of strings.

Here's an example implementation of a JavaScript function to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string using dynamic programming:\njavascript\nfunction longestPalindromicSubstring(str) {\n  let n = str.length;\n  let table = new Array(n).fill().map(() => new Array(n).fill(false));\n  let maxLength = 1;\n  let start = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    table[i][i] = true;\n  }\n  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n    if (str[i] === str[i + 1]) {\n      table[i][i + 1] = true;\n      start = i;\n      maxLength = 2;\n    }\n  }\n  for (let k = 3; k <= n; k++) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < n - k + 1; i++) {\n      let j = i + k - 1;\n      if (table[i + 1][j - 1] && str[i] === str[j]) {\n        table[i][j] = true;\n        if (k > maxLength) {\n          start = i;\n          maxLength = k;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return str.substring(start, start + maxLength);\n}\nThe longestPalindromicSubstring() function takes a string str as input and returns the longest palindromic substring in str. It initializes a two-dimensional array table to store whether a substring is a palindrome or not. It also initializes variables maxLength and start to keep track of the length and starting index of the longest palindromic substring seen so far. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible substrings of str and checks if each substring is a palindrome using dynamic programming. If a substring is a palindrome and its length is greater than the current maximum length, it updates the maxLength and start variables. Finally, it returns the longest palindromic substring.\nFor example, the following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the longestPalindromicSubstring() function to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string:\njavascript\nlet str = 'babad';\nlet longestPalindromicSubstr = longestPalindromicSubstring(str);\nconsole.log(`The longest palindromic substring in ${str} is ${longestPalindromicSubstr}`);\nThis program first initializes a string str. It then calls the longestPalindromicSubstring() function to find the longest palindromic substring in str and stores the result in a variable longestPalindromicSubstr. Finally, it prints a message indicating the input string and the resulting longest palindromic substring.\nNote that there are other algorithms and libraries to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string in JavaScript, such as using brute force or Manacher's algorithm\n1\n2\n. However, the above implementation is a simple and efficient way to perform the computation using dynamic programming in JavaScript.\n1\nw3resource\n2\ngeeksforgeeks"

The function then uses a while loop to iterate over both arrays and compare the elements at each index. If the element in arr1 is smaller than the element in arr2, it is added to mergedArray and i is incremented. If the element in arr2 is smaller than the element in arr1, it is added to mergedArray and j is incremented. If both elements are equal, either one can be added to mergedArray and both i and j are incremented. Once one of the arrays has been fully iterated over, the remaining elements from the other array are added to mergedArray. Finally, the function returns mergedArray\n1\n2\n3\n.\nFor example, the following code merges the arrays [1][4][2][3][5] and [2][5]:\njavascript\nconst arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8];\nconst arr2 = [4, 6, 8, 9, 11];\nconst mergedArray = mergeSortedArrays(arr1, arr2);\nconsole.log(mergedArray);\nThis will output [1][4][2][2][3][5][5].\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input is valid and that the arrays are sorted in ascending order. If the input is not valid or the arrays are not sorted, this implementation will not work. Additionally, it's important to note that while this implementation provides a basic merging of two sorted arrays, there are more advanced merging implementations that may be more suitable for specific use cases.\n1\ntutorialspoint\n2\nwsvincent\n3\ngeeksforgeeks\n4\nstackoverflow\n5\nplainenglish"

The class has a constructor that initializes an empty array of vertices and an empty object of edges. The addVertex() method adds a vertex to the graph by pushing it to the vertices array and adding an empty array to the edges object with the vertex as the key. The addEdge() method adds an undirected edge between two vertices by pushing each vertex to the other's array in the edges object. The breadthFirstTraversal() method performs breadth-first traversal starting from a given vertex by using a queue to keep track of the vertices to visit and a visited object to keep track of the visited vertices. The method returns an array of visited vertices in the order they were visited. The depthFirstTraversal() method performs depth-first traversal starting from a given vertex by using recursion to visit all the vertices in the graph. The method returns an array of visited vertices in the order they were visited\n1\n2\n3\n.\nFor example, the following code creates a graph, adds vertices and edges, and performs breadth-first and depth-first traversal:\njavascript\nconst graph = new Graph();\ngraph.addVertex('A');\ngraph.addVertex('B');\ngraph.addVertex('C');\ngraph.addVertex('D');\ngraph.addEdge('A', 'B');\ngraph.addEdge('B', 'C');\ngraph.addEdge('C', 'D');\ngraph.addEdge('D', 'A');\n\nconst bfsResult = graph.breadthFirstTraversal('A');\nconsole.log(bfsResult); // ['A', 'B', 'D', 'C']\n\nconst dfsResult = graph.depthFirstTraversal('A');\nconsole.log(dfsResult); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\nThis will output ['A', 'B', 'D', 'C'] for breadth-first traversal and ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] for depth-first traversal.\nNote that this implementation provides a basic way to create a graph data structure and perform breadth-first and depth-first traversal.

This means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared, but only if it is declared with the var keyword. If you declare a variable with let or const, you cannot access it before it is initialized with a value\n1\n.\nHere's how hoisting affects variable and function declarations:\nVariable declarations: When a variable is declared with the var keyword, it is hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with a value of undefined. This means that you can use the variable before it is declared, but its value will be undefined until it is assigned a value later in the code\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n. If you declare a variable with let or const, it is also hoisted to the top of its scope, but it is not initialized with a value.

This is because the entire function is hoisted, including its name and body. However, if you declare a function using a function expression (e.g. const myFunc = function() {}), only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function body. This means that you cannot use the function before it is declared\n2\n.\nIn summary, hoisting allows you to use variables and functions before they are declared, but only if they are declared with the var keyword or as function declarations. If you declare a variable with let or const, or a function using a function expression, you cannot use them before they are initialized or declared, respectively.\n1\nmakeuseof\n2\neducative\n3\ndigitalocean\n4\nadripofjavascript\n5\nfreecodecamp\n6\ngeeksforgeeks"

Here are the different data types in JavaScript:\nPrimitive data types: These are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They include:\nString: Used to represent textual data, such as names, addresses, and messages. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes or backticks. For example: \"Hello\", 'World', or `Hello, ${name}!`.\nNumber: Used to represent numeric data, including integers, decimals, and scientific notation. For example: 42, 3.14, or 1.23e-4.\nBoolean: Used to represent logical values, either true or false.\nUndefined: Used to represent a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. For example: let x;.\nNull: Used to represent the intentional absence of any object value. For example: let y = null;.\nSymbol: Used to represent a unique identifier. Symbols are often used as keys in objects. For example: const sym = Symbol('description');.\nBigInt: Used to represent integers with arbitrary precision. BigInts are denoted by appending n to the end of an integer literal. For example: const bigInt = 9007199254740991n;.\nComposite data types: These are complex data types that can hold multiple values. They include:\nObject: Used to represent a collection of related data. Objects are enclosed in curly braces and consist of key-value pairs. For example: const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };.\nArray: Used to represent a collection of values, which can be of any data type. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets. For example: const numbers = [1][2][3][4][5];.\nFunction: Used to represent a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take parameters and return values. For example: function add(a, b) { return a + b; }.\nSpecial data types: These are unique data types in JavaScript. They include:\nNaN: Used to represent a value that is not a number. For example: const result = 10 / 'hello';.\nInfinity: Used to represent a value that is greater than any other number. For example: const max = Number.MAX_VALUE * 2;.\nIn summary, JavaScript has eight primitive data types, three composite data types, and two special data types.

To create an object using the new keyword, you need to have a constructor function. For example:\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n  this.greet = function() {\n    console.log('Hello everyone.');\n  };\n}\n\nconst person1 = new Person('John', 30);\nconst person2 = new Person('Jane', 25);\nCreating objects using Object.create(): This method allows you to create a new object with a specified prototype object. For example:\nconst person = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30,\n  greet: function() {\n    console.log('Hello everyone.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst person1 = Object.create(person);\nperson1.name = 'Jane';\nperson1.age = 25;\nTo access the properties of an object, you can use the dot notation or the bracket notation. For example:\nconsole.log(person.name); // Output: John\nconsole.log(person['age']); // Output: 30\nIn summary, you can create objects in JavaScript using object literal syntax, the new keyword, or Object.create().

Here's an example of how closures can be used:\nfunction outerFunction() {\n  const name = 'John';\n\n  function innerFunction() {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n  }\n\n  return innerFunction;\n}\n\nconst greeting = outerFunction();\ngreeting(); // Output: Hello, John!\nIn this example, outerFunction() returns innerFunction(), which has access to the name variable in outerFunction().

In JavaScript, every object has a private property called [[Prototype]], which points to another object called its prototype\n1\n2\n3\n. When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it is not found, it looks for it on the object's prototype. If it is still not found, it looks for it on the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the prototype chain\n1\n2\n3\n.\nHere's an example of how prototype chaining works:\nconst person = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30,\n  greet: function() {\n    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\n  }\n};\n\nconst student = {\n  major: 'Computer Science',\n  __proto__: person\n};\n\nstudent.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\nIn this example, student is an object that inherits properties and methods from person through the __proto__ property. When student.greet() is called, JavaScript first looks for the greet method on student. Since it is not found, it looks for it on person, where it is found and executed.\nPrototype chaining is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows objects to share properties and methods, reducing code duplication and making code more efficient.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. However, it can handle asynchronous operations by using the event loop. Here's how the event loop works:\nCall stack: When a function is called, it is added to the call stack. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the functions that are currently being executed.\nWeb APIs: When an asynchronous function is called, it is sent to a Web API, which is a built-in API in the browser. The Web API starts its own single-threaded operation and waits for the specified time to send the operation back for processing.\nCallback queue: When the Web API sends the operation back, it is added to the callback queue. The callback queue is a data structure that holds the functions that are ready to be executed.\nEvent loop: The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first function from the callback queue and adds it to the call stack. The function is then executed.\nRepeat: The event loop continues to check the call stack and the callback queue, repeating the process until there are no more functions in the callback queue.\nPrototype chaining is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows objects to share properties and methods, reducing code duplication and making code more efficient.

Promises are important for handling asynchronous programming in web applications, and it’s important to understand how they work and how to use them in your code\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n.\nHere's how promises work:\nCreating a promise: A promise is created using the Promise constructor. The constructor takes a function called the executor function, which takes two parameters: resolve and reject. The resolve function is called when the asynchronous operation is successful, and the reject function is called when the operation fails.\nPending state: When a promise is created, it is in the pending state. This means that the asynchronous operation has not yet completed.\nFulfilled state: When the asynchronous operation is successful, the resolve function is called, and the promise is fulfilled. This means that the operation has completed successfully, and the promise returns the result of the operation.\nRejected state: When the asynchronous operation fails, the reject function is called, and the promise is rejected. This means that the operation has failed, and the promise returns an error.\nPromise chaining: Promises can be chained together using the then() method. This method takes two functions as parameters: onFulfilled and onRejected. The onFulfilled function is called when the promise is fulfilled, and the onRejected function is called when the promise is rejected.\nPromises are used for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

Here are some examples of DOM manipulation operations:\nSelecting elements: We can select elements in the DOM using various methods such as getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector(), etc. These methods return a reference to the selected element, which can be used to manipulate the element.\nCreating elements: We can create new elements in the DOM using the createElement() method. This method creates a new element with the specified tag name and returns a reference to the new element. We can then add the new element to the DOM using the appendChild() method.\nModifying elements: We can modify the content of an element using the textContent and innerHTML properties. The textContent property sets or returns the text content of an element, while the innerHTML property sets or returns the HTML content of an element.\nRemoving elements: We can remove elements from the DOM using the removeChild() method.

        "Output": "Closures and the module pattern are two important concepts in JavaScript that can be used to create private variables and encapsulation.\nClosures:\nA closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) function, even after the outer function has returned.\nClosures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.\nClosures are used to create private variables and functions in JavaScript.\nClosures can be used to create modular and reusable code.\nClosures are created when a function is defined, not when it is executed.\nModule Pattern:\nThe module pattern is a design pattern in JavaScript that allows you to create private variables and functions and expose a public API for other parts of your code to use.\nThe module pattern uses closures to create private variables and functions.\nThe module pattern provides a way of wrapping a mix of public and private methods and variables inside a single object, thus shielding particular parts from the global scope.\nThe module pattern can be used to create modular and reusable code.\nThe module pattern can be implemented using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).\nHere's an example of how to use the module pattern to create private variables and encapsulation:\nconst myModule = (function() {\n  let privateVar = 0;\n\n  function privateFunction() {\n    console.log('Private function called');\n  }\n\n  return {\n    publicVar: 1,\n    publicFunction: function() {\n      console.log('Public function called');\n    }\n  };\n})();\n\nconsole.log(myModule.publicVar); // Output: 1\nmyModule.publicFunction(); // Output: 'Public function called'\nconsole.log(myModule.privateVar); // Output: undefined\nmyModule.privateFunction(); // Output: TypeError: myModule.privateFunction is not a function\nIn this example, we use an IIFE to create a module that has a private variable and a private function. We then return an object that has a public variable and a public function that can be accessed from outside the module. The private variable and function cannot be accessed from outside the module.\nIn summary, closures and the module pattern are two important concepts in JavaScript that can be used to create private variables and encapsulation. Closures allow you to create functions that have access to variables in their outer function, while the module pattern allows you to create private variables and functions and expose a public API for other parts of your code to use.\n1\njoezimjs\n2\nplainenglish\n3\nstackoverflow\n4\nmozilla\n5\noreilly"

Understanding how to work with the prototype object is essential for creating efficient and reusable JavaScript code that uses object-oriented programming principles.\nSources:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript/\nhttps://www.scaler.com/topics/javascript/prototype-inheritance-in-javascript/\nhttps://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript\n1\nmozilla\n2\nfreecodecamp\n3\nscaler\n4\njavascript\n5\nmozilla"

The === operator checks for strict equality, which means the variables or values on both sides must have the same data type and value.\nHere are some examples to illustrate the difference between == and === operators:\nconsole.log(2 == \"2\"); // true\nconsole.log(2 === \"2\"); // false\nconsole.log(0 == \"\"); // true\nconsole.log(0 === \"\"); // false\nconsole.log(null == undefined); // true\nconsole.log(null === undefined); // false\nIn the first example, the == operator returns true because it coerces the string \"2\" to the number 2 before comparison. In the second example, the === operator returns false because it compares the number 2 with the string \"2\", which are not of the same data type. In the third example, the == operator returns true because it coerces the empty string \"\" to the number 0 before comparison. In the fourth example, the === operator returns false because it compares the number 0 with the empty string \"\", which are not of the same data type. In the fifth example, the == operator returns true because null and undefined are loosely equal. In the sixth example, the === operator returns false because null and undefined are not strictly equal.\nIn summary, the == operator is called the abstract equality operator, while the === operator is called the strict equality operator. The == operator performs type coercion, while the === operator does not. The == operator checks for abstract equality, while the === operator checks for strict equality. Understanding the difference between == and === operators is important for writing correct and efficient JavaScript code.\nSources:\n[Educative.io]\n1\n[Guru99]\n2\n[STechies]\n3\n[C Corner]\n4\n[MDN Web Docs]\n5\n[FreeCodeCamp]\n6\n1\n: https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-difference-between-and-operator-in-javascript\n2\n: https://www.guru99.com/difference-equality-strict-operator-javascript.html\n3\n: https://www.stechies.com/difference-between--javascript/\n4\n: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/difference-between-and-in-javascript2/\n5\n: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality\n6\n: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/loose-vs-strict-equality-in-javascript/\n1\neducative\n2\nguru99\n3\nstechies\n4\nc-sharpcorner\n5\nmozilla\n6\nfreecodecamp"

        "Input": "Explain the concept of the prototype object in JavaScript and how it is used for object inheritance.",
        "Output": "Prototype Object in JavaScript and Object Inheritance\nIn JavaScript, objects are created using constructors or literals. Each object has a hidden property called [[Prototype]], which is a reference to another object called its prototype. The prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. This chain of objects is called the prototype chain, and it is used for object inheritance. Here are some key points about the prototype object in JavaScript:\nThe prototype object is a template or blueprint for creating objects.\nThe prototype object is used for object inheritance, which allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.\nThe prototype object is accessed using the Object.getPrototypeOf() method or the __proto__ property.\nThe prototype object can be modified using the Object.create() method or the Object.setPrototypeOf() method.\nHere's an example of how to use the prototype object for object inheritance:\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\n\nPerson.prototype.greet = function() {\n  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\n}\n\nfunction Student(name, age, grade) {\n  Person.call(this, name, age);\n  this.grade = grade;\n}\n\nStudent.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);\nStudent.prototype.constructor = Student;\n\nStudent.prototype.study = function() {\n  console.log(`${this.name} is studying in grade ${this.grade}.`);\n}\n\nconst john = new Student(\"John\", 18, 12);\njohn.greet(); // Hello, my name is John and I am 18 years old.\njohn.study(); // John is studying in grade 12.\nIn this example, we define a Person constructor function that takes a name and an age parameter. We add a greet() method to the Person prototype object. We then define a Student constructor function that takes a name, an age, and a grade parameter. We call the Person constructor function inside the Student constructor function using the call() method to set the name and age properties. We then create a new Student prototype object that inherits from the Person prototype object using the Object.create() method. We set the constructor property of the Student prototype object to Student. We add a study() method to the Student prototype object. Finally, we create a new Student object called john and call the greet() and study() methods.\nIn summary, the prototype object is a template or blueprint for creating objects in JavaScript. The prototype object is used for object inheritance, which allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. Understanding how to work with the prototype object is essential for creating efficient and reusable JavaScript code.\nSources:\n[MDN Web Docs]\n1\n[FreeCodeCamp]\n2\n[Scaler]\n3\n[The Modern JavaScript Tutorial]\n4\n[DigitalOcean]\n5\n1\n: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain\n2\n: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript/\n3\n: https://www.scaler.com/topics/javascript/prototype-inheritance-in-javascript/\n4\n: https://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance\n5\n: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript\n1\nmozilla\n2\nfreecodecamp\n3\nscaler\n4\njavascript\n5\nmozilla"

They are used to store user information, such as login credentials, preferences, and shopping cart items. In JavaScript, cookies can be handled using the document.cookie property and cookie manipulation methods. Here's how to use the document.cookie property to handle cookies:\nSetting a Cookie: To set a cookie, assign a string value to the document.cookie property. The string should be in the format name=value;expires=date;path=path;domain=domain;secure. The name and value parameters are required, while the expires, path, domain, and secure parameters are optional.\ndocument.cookie = \"username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 22 Jul 2023 12:00:00 UTC; path=/\";\nIn this example, we set a cookie named username with the value John Doe. The cookie expires on July 22, 2023, and is accessible from the root path.\nGetting a Cookie: To get a cookie, read the document.cookie property. The property returns a string of all cookies available to the page, separated by semicolons.\nconst cookies = document.cookie;\nconsole.log(cookies);\nIn this example, we read the document.cookie property and log the result to the console.\nDeleting a Cookie: To delete a cookie, set the expires parameter to a date in the past.\ndocument.cookie = \"username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;\";\nIn this example, we delete the username cookie by setting the expires parameter to January 1, 1970.\nIn summary, cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a web server. In JavaScript, cookies can be handled using the document.cookie property and cookie manipulation methods. To set a cookie, assign a string value to the document.cookie property.

Here are some key points about memoization in JavaScript:\nMemoization is an optimization technique that can be used to reduce extensive calculations by saving previous input to output mappings.\nMemoization is based on the concepts of closures and higher-order functions.\nMemoization is not only limited to JavaScript but is also widely supported by many other programming languages.\nMemoization can significantly reduce processing time and improve the performance of applications, especially when dealing with repetitive and heavy computing functions.\nMemoization can be implemented using an object to store the cached results or using a memoization library.\nMemoization is a programming concept that can be applied to any programming language. Its fundamental goal is to optimize your program. This is mainly seen if a program is performing heavy computations. Memoization will cache these computation results so that it will not have to strain while executing a heavy operation that requires a previously executed computation. Memoization can be implemented using an object to store the cached results or using a memoization library.\nHere's an example of how to use memoization in JavaScript:\njavascript\nfunction fibonacci(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) {\n    return n;\n  }\n  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);\n}\n\nfunction memoize(fn) {\n  const cache = {};\n  return function(...args) {\n    if (cache[args]) {\n      return cache[args];\n    }\n    const result = fn.apply(this, args);\n    cache[args] = result;\n    return result;\n  };\n}\n\nconst memoizedFibonacci = memoize(fibonacci);\n\nconsole.log(memoizedFibonacci(10)); // 55\nconsole.log(memoizedFibonacci(10)); // 55 (cached)\nIn this example, we define a fibonacci function that recursively calculates the nth Fibonacci number. We then define a memoize function that takes a function as an argument and returns a memoized version of the function. The memoized function stores the results of previous function calls in a cache object and returns the cached result when the same arguments are passed in again.\nWe then create a memoized version of the fibonacci function using the memoize function and call it twice with the same argument. The first call calculates the result and stores it in the cache object. The second call retrieves the result from the cache object and returns it without recomputing the result.\nIn summary, memoization is an optimization technique in JavaScript that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization can be implemented using an object to store the cached results or using a memoization library. Understanding how to work with memoization is essential for creating efficient and responsive JavaScript applications that deal with repetitive and heavy computing functions.\nSources:\n[Medium]\n1\n[GeeksforGeeks]\n2\n[DEV Community]\n3\n[Engineering Education]\n4\n[Scaler]\n5\n[Bits and Pieces]\n6\n1\n: https://nickychristensen.medium.com/memoization-in-javascript-53db416e0ee3\n2\n: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-memoization/\n3\n: https://dev.to/rakibrahman/memoization-in-javascript-and-how-to-apply-it-to-get-better-code-performance-5d8k\n4\n: https://www.section.io/engineering-education/an-introduction-to-memoization-in-javascript/\n5\n: https://www.scaler.com/topics/javascript/prototype-inheritance-in-javascript/\n6\n: https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-memoization-in-javascript-to-improve-performance-2763ab107092\n1\nmedium\n2\ngeeksforgeeks\n3\ndev\n4\nsection\n5\nscaler\n6\nbitsrc"

        "Output": "Handling Cookies in JavaScript\nCookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a web server. Cookies are used to store user information, such as login credentials, shopping cart items, and user preferences. In JavaScript, cookies can be managed using the document.cookie property and cookie manipulation methods. Here are the steps to handle cookies in JavaScript:\nCreate a Cookie: To create a cookie, you can set the document.cookie property to a string that contains the cookie name, value, and optional attributes such as the expiration date and path.\nRead a Cookie: To read a cookie, you can access the document.cookie property, which returns a string of all cookies available to the page. You can then parse the string to extract the value of a specific cookie.\nUpdate a Cookie: To update a cookie, you can create a new cookie with the same name and a new value. The browser will overwrite the old cookie with the new one.\nDelete a Cookie: To delete a cookie, you can set the expiration date of the cookie to a date in the past. The browser will remove the cookie from the user's computer.\nHere's an example of how to use the document.cookie property to create, read, update, and delete a cookie:\njavascript\n// Create a cookie\ndocument.cookie = \"username=johndoe; expires=Thu, 22 Jul 2023 12:00:00 UTC; path=/\";\n\n// Read a cookie\nconst cookies = document.cookie.split(\"; \");\nfor (const cookie of cookies) {\n  const [name, value] = cookie.split(\"=\");\n  if (name === \"username\") {\n    console.log(value);\n  }\n}\n\n// Update a cookie\ndocument.cookie = \"username=janesmith; expires=Thu, 22 Jul 2023 12:00:00 UTC; path=/\";\n\n// Delete a cookie\ndocument.cookie = \"username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;\";\nIn this example, we create a cookie called username with the value johndoe, an expiration date of July 22, 2023, and a path of /. We then read the value of the username cookie by splitting the document.cookie string and parsing the resulting array. We update the value of the username cookie to janesmith and delete the username cookie by setting its expiration date to a date in the past.\nIn summary, cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a web server. In JavaScript, cookies can be managed using the document.cookie property and cookie manipulation methods.

        "Output": "Difference between == and === Operators in JavaScript\nIn JavaScript, there are two types of equality operators: == and ===. The == operator is called the abstract equality operator, while the === operator is called the strict equality operator. They both are used to check for equality, but they work differently. Here are the key differences between the two operators:\nThe == operator is the abstract equality operator, while the === operator is the strict equality operator.\nThe == operator compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type.\nThe === operator compares two values for equality without converting their types.\nThe == operator is less strict than the === operator.\nThe === operator is generally considered to be safer and more reliable than the == operator.\nHere are some examples to illustrate the difference between the two operators:\njavascript\nconsole.log(2 == \"2\"); // true\nconsole.log(2 === \"2\"); // false\n\nconsole.log(0 == \"\"); // true\nconsole.log(0 === \"\"); // false\n\nconsole.log(null == undefined); // true\nconsole.log(null === undefined); // false\nIn the first example, the == operator returns true because the string \"2\" is converted to the number 2 before the comparison is made. The === operator returns false because it sees that the data types are different.\nIn the second example, the == operator returns true because the empty string is converted to the number 0 before the comparison is made. The === operator returns false because it sees that the data types are different.\nIn the third example, the == operator returns true because null and undefined are considered equal by the abstract equality operator. The === operator returns false because it sees that the data types are different.\nIn summary, the == operator is the abstract equality operator, while the === operator is the strict equality operator. The == operator compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type, while the === operator compares two values for equality without converting their types.

        "Output": "Reversing a Linked List in JavaScript\nReversing a linked list is a common interview question in JavaScript. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Reversing a linked list means changing the direction of the references between the nodes so that the last node becomes the first node, and the first node becomes the last node. Here are some strategies to reverse a linked list in JavaScript:\nIterative Approach: The iterative approach involves iterating through the linked list and reversing the direction of the references between the nodes. This approach requires keeping track of three pointers: the current node, the previous node, and the next node.\nRecursive Approach: The recursive approach involves recursively traversing the linked list and reversing the direction of the references between the nodes. This approach requires a base case to stop the recursion and a recursive call to traverse the linked list.\nHere's an example of how to reverse a linked list in JavaScript using the iterative approach:\njavascript\nfunction reverseLinkedList(head) {\n  let current = head;\n  let previous = null;\n  while (current) {\n    let next = current.next;\n    current.next = previous;\n    previous = current;\n    current = next;\n  }\n  return previous;\n}\nIn this example, we define a reverseLinkedList function that takes the head of a linked list as an argument and returns the new head of the reversed linked list. We initialize the current pointer to the head of the linked list and the previous pointer to null. We then iterate through the linked list using a while loop and reverse the direction of the references between the nodes by setting the next pointer to the next node, the current.next pointer to the previous node, the previous pointer to the current node, and the current pointer to the next node. Finally, we return the previous pointer as the new head of the reversed linked list.\nHere's an example of how to reverse a linked list in JavaScript using the recursive approach:\njavascript\nfunction reverseLinkedList(head) {\n  if (!head || !head.next) {\n    return head;\n  }\n  let newHead = reverseLinkedList(head.next);\n  head.next.next = head;\n  head.next = null;\n  return newHead;\n}\nIn this example, we define a reverseLinkedList function that takes the head of a linked list as an argument and returns the new head of the reversed linked list. We use a recursive approach to traverse the linked list and reverse the direction of the references between the nodes. We define a base case that stops the recursion when the head pointer is null or the head.next pointer is null. We then recursively call the reverseLinkedList function with the head.next pointer and set the newHead pointer to the returned value. We then reverse the direction of the references between the nodes by setting the head.next.next pointer to the head node, the head.next pointer to null, and the newHead pointer to the head.next node. Finally, we return the newHead pointer as the new head of the reversed linked list.\nIn summary, reversing a linked list is a common interview question in JavaScript.

Implementing a singly linked list in TypeScript involves defining a Node class that represents a node in the linked list and a LinkedList class that represents the linked list itself. Here's an example of how to implement a singly linked list in TypeScript:\ntypescript\nclass Node<T> {\n  data: T;\n  next: Node<T> | null;\n  constructor(data: T) {\n    this.data = data;\n    this.next = null;\n  }\n}\n\nclass LinkedList<T> {\n  head: Node<T> | null;\n  constructor() {\n    this.head = null;\n  }\n  insertAtEnd(data: T): void {\n    const newNode = new Node(data);\n    if (!this.head) {\n      this.head = newNode;\n      return;\n    }\n    let current = this.head;\n    while (current.next) {\n      current = current.next;\n    }\n    current.next = newNode;\n  }\n  insertAtBeginning(data: T): void {\n    const newNode = new Node(data);\n    newNode.next = this.head;\n    this.head = newNode;\n  }\n  deleteNode(data: T): void {\n    if (!this.head) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (this.head.data === data) {\n      this.head = this.head.next;\n      return;\n    }\n    let current = this.head;\n    while (current.next) {\n      if (current.next.data === data) {\n        current.next = current.next.next;\n        return;\n      }\n      current = current.next;\n    }\n  }\n  printList(): void {\n    let current = this.head;\n    while (current) {\n      console.log(current.data);\n      current = current.next;\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this example, we define a Node class that represents a node in the linked list.

The LinkedList class has methods to insert a node at the end of the linked list, insert a node at the beginning of the linked list, delete a node from the linked list, and print the contents of the linked list.\nWe use generics to make the Node and LinkedList classes reusable for any data type. We also use optional chaining (?.) to avoid errors when accessing properties of null or undefined values.\nHere's an example of how to use the LinkedList class to create and manipulate a linked list:\ntypescript\nconst list = new LinkedList<number>();\nlist.insertAtEnd(1);\nlist.insertAtEnd(2);\nlist.insertAtEnd(3);\nlist.insertAtBeginning(0);\nlist.deleteNode(2);\nlist.printList(); // 0 1 3\nIn this example, we create a new LinkedList object called list and insert four nodes into the linked list using the insertAtEnd and insertAtBeginning methods.

If the target value is less than the middle element, the search is continued in the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search is continued in the right half of the array. This approach requires keeping track of two pointers: the low pointer and the high pointer.\nRecursive Approach: The recursive approach involves recursively dividing the array into two halves and comparing the target value with the middle element of the array.
